 Problems building LOIC with mdtool build file not found
 I'm working on an Ubuntu server and am trying to build LOIC as instructed in the support documentation. When I write mdtool build I get the error project file not found. I'm in the folder containing LOIC when I run the command.

The project file in inside the src folder.

Alternatively you could use loic.sh or loic-net4.5.sh script (depends on the .net version available on your system)

 Help with running/compiling
 Would you be able to help me with the launch options for LOIC? Im messing around and just want to compile my own version. Thanks!
Download the source code and have fun.

There's a LOIC.sln in src folder that you can open with Visual Studio and might be also openable by Mono Develop. If not use LOIC.csproj



 Mac OS mono

mono --arch=32 /LOIC_2/LOIC.exe

Mac OS Catalina 
32 bit mono will not run on catalina, apple removed 32 bit support.

How to run this on Macos catalina 
Thanks

In theory you could compile it from source using monodevelop and submit any necessary patches as a pull request.

 Wishlist: Support HOIC
 Since you already interested in LOIC which is more of DOS rather than DDOS, it would be nice to complete the puzzle by having HOIC instructions. (didnt see any on github)

https://sourceforge.net/projects/high-orbit-ion-cannon/

ThX!
Closing as this is not planed.

 Wishlist: Add Loic to Debian or to Kali/Parrot
 Its preferable to have loic uploaded to Debian repos or any penetration testing like Kali/Parrot if it will be rewritten in GTK or JSON or PyQt...etc 

ThX!
Marking as `wontfix`. This a legacy tool and rewrites are not planned.

 Wrong/old instructions of wine installation
 Wine instructions doesnt work directly as it mentioned here it needs some improvements: 

There is Wine64 and Wine32 , `apt install wine` it will install wine64 because Debian and most distros deprecating/not using by default i386 architecture, so user need to specify the wine version.

Better refer the user to install wine on debian from the official website of winehq: 

https://wiki.winehq.org/Debian

(why do we need 32bit? because loic architecture is 32bit)

I have edited the wiki entry to add your comment:
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/wiki/How-to-run-LOIC-using-Wine

Ok awesome! 

Thx :)

Closing as resolved.

 Mono method is outdated
 Im trying to install it using mono method but `monodevelop` package doesnt exist anymore thus hindering the installation of it. 
Read the comment of the loic.sh and loic-net4.5.sh
```
# Before using you must install monodevelop from:
# https://www.monodevelop.com/download/#fndtn-download-lin
```
You need to install their package first from their own repository since some distributions no longer include it.

I have added this info to the article in the wiki: https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/wiki/How-to-run-LOIC-using-Mono

alright great!

closing as resolved.

 Running LOIC with mono on macOS
 Mono has been installed with mono's installer package (though the same error occurred when trying to run with mono installed from homebrew), and LOIC has been compiled `./loic.sh install`. The error was received when running `./loic.sh run`:
```
grep: /etc/*-release: No such file or directory

I am able to run LOIC with Wine (after having installed dotnet20), so it /can/ run on macOS.

`./loic.sh` (Dotnet 4.0) and `./loic-net4.5.sh` (Dotnet 4.5) are only intended & tested for Linux systems.

 HackTool:Win32?
 My antivirus found the Oylecann virus associated with the Fynloski backdoor Trojan and I don't want to give anyone access to my PC. So I should use a different penetration test program. I just wanted to report this problem.
This an "Hack Tool" if you use it right. However it is a get v&ed tool if you use it wrong.

If you trust the Antivirus is right, then you shouldn't use this tool anyway.

Hey, just wanting to clarify this issue. Are we looking to put together a console version of LOIC? 

Apologies if this is a dumb question -James 

sorry

Feel free to contribute @JamesMatchett 

 bring ssl irc!
 some channels wont even allow loic!!
Are you able to give a slightly more detailed description of the issue? @HACKER-3000

Are you using the latest version of the install script?
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/blob/master/loic.sh

Can you tell me the Linux distro & version?

I'm using Kali Linux 2018.3 (32bit version) all updated and upgraded. And using that same LOIC file.
Full error: https://pastebin.com/AnWjhsTF
Uname: Linux en0xCr3w 4.17.0-kali1-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 4.17.8-1kali1 (2018-07-24) i686 GNU/Linux

Okay. Seems like they killed .net 4.0 for good.

Please try this script instead:
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/blob/master/loic-net4.5.sh

I did not test it, but might work...

@NewEraCracker Installation was successful now.
Thank you very much.
https://pastebin.com/SPQL6FQX - This issue now with update command after install !!

You should probably do the following.
git clean -fx
./loic-net4.5.sh update

Yep it worked.
Thank you very much Sir :+1: 

Just to make sure.

You're using the very latest version, right?
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/commits/master

Also mind making sure the 
loic-net4.5.sh install
Is working fine with the packages I'm using.
Thanks a lot!

Ask in Ubuntu forums how to fix this.

It is amazing how backwards compatibility is always broken when major releases happen.

Related to #79 ?

It is not actually new.

It's Mono, they like to break backward compatiblity!

Fixed!

don't install this guys. there's no legitimate LOIC anymore. this is a rat

LOIC is shit now anyway. it uses old methods that can be easily avoided

Any ideas what's wrong ? It used to work fine.
Just to double-check, are you using this script or the very old copy?
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/blob/master/loic.sh

I was using the old one now. But the new one also gives me errors when installing.
Check output here:
[http://rawstring.com/paste/?5f0c3b75715d1fa7#PX+jQ0TcyQivLuhcmchomdIbt9GW1te+Bhxz2u8MR8U=](url)

Let me know how the script goes with the recent change.

Tried with new changes, only change I see is the text comes in colors now.
[http://rawstring.com/paste/?682c59adbdb3055c#wrw+wUwkZL5P8lWd26RbH2lKidOPQfZa9cWEWFTxUD0=](url)

Maybe doing the following could help:
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/blob/master/loic.sh
Edit line 77 from:
```cd src; xbuild /p:TargetFrameworkVersion="v4.0"```
To:
```cd src; xbuild /p:TargetFrameworkVersion="v4.5"```

Reference:
https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/issues/86

Changed the 77th line.
Now it's output looks like this:
[http://rawstring.com/paste/?85f42c350c481411#v6b/vOWNFab+HJGr+PpyPGyDwMJBbttLJN05brtFIO4=](url)

Better. Should have been built.

I'll keep this bug open until I figure a solution to detect available .net versions on the linux distro.

Error log snippet for future reference:
```

```

Maybe it's due to new kernel update ?

I doubt it. It's more an issue with some new version of mono or package configuration breaking backwards compatibility with projects for older versions of .net framework.

Fixed.

 license clarification
 What's the license for the code in this repo?
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/blob/master/LICENSE.md

 James Matchett- Add ICMP attack method
 Third time's the charm, as per issue #64.

Adds the option for ICMP (ping flood) attacks either with no data in the buffer sent with the ping or a random amount of random bits (up to 65500) in the buffer.

Random bits selected with the "Append random chars" checkbox when ICMP is selected in the method box and number of pings per thread selected with Sockets/thread when ICMP is selected.

Hope this helps contribute towards the program, hope to help write further methods in the future

-with thanks, James
Amazing! Thanks a lot for the contribution. Will merge soon.

So, I have improved the code and it is now on master. Please let me know if it works well for you.

Just read through the changes, looks perfect :) , thank you very much 👍 

 James Matchett- Add ICMP attack method 
 Hopefully Commit coming through clearer now, 

As per issue #64 

Adds the option for ICMP (ping flood) attacks either with no data in the buffer sent with the ping or a random amount of random bits (up to 65500) in the buffer.

Random bits selected with the "Append random chars" checkbox when ICMP is selected in the method box and number of pings per thread selected with Sockets/thread when ICMP is selected.

Things I would change: Drop port number from ICMP method call in cHLDos.cs as it is unnecessary in ICMP pings. I would also like to go over the GUI checkboxes selectable when ICMP is selected.

Thanks a bunch, James 
Looks good. Thanks a lot. I may do some changes before integrating on master.

That's brilliant, thank you very much :)- James

Have you pushed the latest commit through browser or git client? It introduced a gigantic amount of whitespace changes.

Apologies, bad commit on my part a few mintues ago,  I was being an idiot and uploaded to the wrong branch of mine. I can't get the git client installed where I am during studies and wanted to save a small change to a different branch.
I can revert it as soon as I get back home, I'm so sorry for adding to the workload, I'll get it done asap.

Hi, sorry again for the stupid mistake, I've pushed the files from git desktop from home. I tried pushing the master then pushing my changes after that so changes only would be highlighted. The large diff number is still appearing. Do you think a new pull request would be the easiest option or is there a better way?

Sorry again, James 

Yeah, just do another pull request. Sorry for the hassle.

not a problem, I've learnt my lesson, stick to git dekstop from now on. Will have that done soon :) 

 James matchett ICMP Flood Method Addition 
 As per Issue #64 requesting more attack methods

Adds the ability for ICMP flood style attacks both with and without data being added to the ping by toggling the append random chars flag where if chosen appends between 0 and 65500 random bytes to the ping buffer. Also using the Sockets/thread as a selector for pings sent per thread.

I've kept the coding for this method as similar to that for other methods within the LOIC. 

Things I want to change: update all GUI options so that irrelevant ones are non-selectable, i did this with most but not all options on screen. 

Added the method to ChLDos.cs and made appropriate additions to protocol.cs and frmMain.cs to make it all work, I feel it's a good addition for testing and I believe I could improve how the method works over time.
Apologies for the massive amounts of "files changed" it appears on one of the commits I may have uploaded the entire folder without making any alterations. 
From memory only files changed are
frmMain.cs
cHLDos.cs
Protocol.cs


What editor are you using to edit the files? What client are you using to upload them?

using visual studio to develop, i made an error when uploading, would you like me to make a new fork from master and upload the updated files? and I'm using chrome browser to commit files.

I appreciate your effort but please use the windows git client instead of a browser. It will probably prevent this gigantic mess.

Thanks.

no worries I'll get started on that right away! sorry for the mess still finding my way around github, Thanks a bunch for the prompt reply , Should i close this and make a new pull request when ready? 

I'll close this. Submit another one when ready. Thanks.

 no .exe file?
 So i downloaded it but can't see .exe file in /bin/Debug. Is there an update going on atm?
Binaries are available at:
https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/releases

Closing this

 More Attack methods?
 Some Like:
Tcp
Tcp-ack
RST/FIN
Dns
ICMP
ACK
Syn
Syn-Ack
SSDP
NTP
SNMP
CharGEN
Don't you need amp lists if you want to use NTP for example?

ICMP has been implemented. The others won't be unless I have very good PRs for it.

Hi @NewEraCracker , would you like further attack methods developed or would you prefer me to work on other issues at the moment?

Thanks, James

I think I know what you need. I am in process of fixing.

 HTTPS method
 I was looking at the http request if it were sent to port 443 and the request were shown as unencrypted
so i was assuming since a lot of sites are getting SSL on their server then adding HTTPS would be a great idea.

I was also thinking maybe you should add like a proxy settings for the HTTP methods
that would be cool.
You should add the proxy feature. It'll make ur program more popular and have more vast options.

Proxy? For loic? That's like trying to shoot an rpg-7 through a keyhole.


A proxy feature for the HTTP/HTTPS method is a great idea but adding a proxy feature for LOIC in general is like shooting an rpg-7 through a keyhole.

I wonder... As possible workaround, what about tunelling the requests through stunnel? I bet it might consume a lot of CPU but it's a possibility.

 Slow HTTP Attacks
 Adding slow HTTP DoS attacks would be nice. I'll open a pull request if/when I manage to get it done on my local repo.
Some methods are available on the not-yet-released 2.9.9.99 (to become 3.0.0.0) on the 'master' branch. You can build manually with Visual Studio 2010+ or Mono.

 General Syntax and Grammatical Corrections.
