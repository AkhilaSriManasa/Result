 Added DeviceGuard and PowerShell Logging event IDs
 I have added three new functions. The first is `CheckDeviceGuard()` which checks the current status of CredentialGuard and its related services. I added this function into the `system` enumeration.

I also added two functions to `ListPowerShellSettings`: `List4103Events()` and `List4104Events()`

These functions look for any recent instances of 4103 or 4104 events and then returns a count of how many were found. Even if logging is not enabled, there may still be events that could be of interest, like commands executed remotely.

If `full` is provided as an option these functions will return some information about the events, such as the name/path of the script and the account used to execute the commands. The functions also collect the full contents of the commands/script blocks, but I commented out the output. It can be _a lot of text_ and may be better to grab the contents after triage.

In place of full scrip block output, I experimented with searching the commands for instances of keywords like `PSCredential` and `password` to highlight events that may contain logged plaintext passwords.
 Added Carbon Black, Cylance, and CrowdStrike Processes
 Added Carbon Black Defense and Cylance Protect executable processes to "ListInterestingProcesses" hashtable.
 Add Xen to IsVirtualMachine
 Simply added a new condition to IsVirtualMachine, so that VMs running on Citrix XenServer are correctly reported as being virtual.
 Added CrowdStrike EDR
 Added CSFalconContainer.exe process.
 Split Program.cs to separate focused files
 ### Why these changes?:

Similarly to the refactoring in **Rubeus** and **Watson** (https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson), the 6927 line `program.cs` class is a bit of a monster here too. 
This is a nightmare to try to read and understand, and will be a problem to maintain and add to going forward.


### What's changed - in brief:
+ Each 'check' has been moved to a `probe` class in `\Probes\`
+ Added an option `ToFile` - that allows outputting the results to a file
+ Performance improvements around the filesystem scanning:  
**Before:** Completed All Safety Checks in **41** seconds  
**Now:** Completed All Safety Checks in **18** seconds
+ Merged:  
PR 14 (https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt/pull/14) (and fixed a null reference exception)  
PR 15 (https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt/pull/15)
+ Better handling of exceptions allowing checks to continue rather than fail early
+ Re-written command line arguments parser  
+ The command line isn't case sensitive any more


### What hasn't changed:
+ Any of the P/Invoke voodoo  
+ The version number.
+ still .Net 3.5 (this is a pain in the arse for VS 2017 tbh)

### Comments

While working on the code I noticed that `all` wasn't running *all* the available checks - as the help text implied - **this version will run all the available checks if `all` is selected** <- is this correct? If not the `ProbePresets\AllPreset.cs` can simply be changed and the original lines uncommitted.

The probes are in the `Probes` folder and the *Presets* ( *full* \ *all* \ *user* \ *system* ) are in the `ProbePresets` Folder

The new version produces a lot more output - due to better coping with exceptions.

### Testing
I've tested the changes on 2 machines by piping the output from the original version and new versions, and Diffing the output. As far as I can see the functionality between the 2 versions is unchanged except for newline differences and the extra output as noted above.


### How to add new probes?

Every probe/check class needs to implement `IProbe` and have a `ProbeName` property to identify the check.

```
    public class ANewProbe : IProbe
    {
        public static string ProbeName => "NewProbe";
        
        public string List()
        {

            // All code for the check goes here
            // return the results as a string

        }
    }
```

The program will automatically add the probe to the available probes and call it if required. (Just need to add the name & info to the `Info.cs` class)


 Add ListAppLockerSettings()
 Created a new `ListAppLockerSettings()` function and added it to the `system` check.
Example output:

```
> Seatbelt.exe system

 Fix issues with parsing of Service binary paths
 Seatbelt parses and enumerates services via WMI, and attempts to pull information out of the binaries that the service points to. There were a few issues with the approach that was taken:

* It didn't cover cases where service paths were quoted or had spaces (such as Motorola's Bluetooh OBEX Service).
* It didn't handle cases where service binaries didn't have an extension (such as Carbon Black's Sensor agent).
* It didn't seem to correctly handle arguments passed to the service.
* When errors were encountered while parsing the file information, there was no try/catch around a single case, and hence the entire service parsing loop was exited (resulting in the rest of the services not being enumerated).

This PR attempts to fix this problem. It should handle quoted service paths, files without extensions, and cases where arguments are passed to the service exe.

There are some thorough comments on the approach in the code, but basically it does the following:

1. Assumes that if a quote exists it's in the binary path, and makes use of that assumption, by taking what's after the first quote (based on a simple split). This _might_ fail if the service binary isn't quoted, but an argument is quoted.
1. Assumes from there that anything before the first space is the target binary.
1. Catches the exception in the file version info call so that we don't bail on the whole loop.

This approach makes it work in the cases I saw breakages on a recent machine I ran it on.

Thoughts and feedback welcome. Thanks!
  Improve FindFiles() performance by removing unecessary operations
 Previously, when several patterns where passed, the function would recurse in sub directories for each pattern.
With this version and for each folder, all patterns are searched in the folder's files, but then, the function digs in each subdirectory only once.
In my tests, the `ListInterestingFiles` operation used to take 170s, for 595 interesting files found, and with this it takes 55s, and discovers the same files (no regression).
 ListLocalGroupMembers() code factorization, and add handling of unresolved SIDs
 Factorized code is easier to maintain :)
And handle the case when "S-1-5-32-580" for "Remote Management Users" (or any other) is missing, e.g. on older versions of Windows
 Get command line from listening processes
 
 Windows Vault Add-On
 Added a new function `DumpVault` that will search the Window's Vault for saved credentials and print them to the console. Useful for retrieving things such as saved Internet Explorer and Edge credentials. If something doesn't look right let me know and I can make the requisite changes; cheers! 
 Create .gitignore with common VS exclusions
 
 Add handling of PathTooLongException in FindFiles()

 Small typo "Triagechrome" -> "TriageChrome"

 Improve error message in ListDNSCache() when using Windows before 8/2012
 The 'MSFT_DNSClientCache' WMI class is unavailable on older Windows versions

I also moved the "=== DNS Cache (via WMI) ===" line, because if an exception occurs, we get the exception printed but without the header and we do not know in which section the problem is.

 Same as in ListNetworkShares() just after
