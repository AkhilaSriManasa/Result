 Corrected Dutch Easter holiday names
 > The Dutch have a two-day holiday, called Eerste Paasdag on Sunday and Tweede Paasdag on Monday (lit. First Easter Day and Second Easter Day)

I also changed the spelling of the 2 Christmas holidays of the Netherlands. There are 2 official rules (_Het Groene Boekje_ and _Het Witte Boekje_) that may be used to determine whether both letters should be written in capital. I used the most common rule, because this looks nicer in my opinion.

Because of some Github markdown limitation preventing displaying checkboxes inside tables, I had to use [this hack](https://gist.github.com/pchaigno/1826ba1151890b751862#file-checkboxes-md) to make it work. Let me know if it is a problem.
