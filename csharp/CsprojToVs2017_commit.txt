 Fix #260: Crash when project contains NeutralResourcesLanguage attribute
 Merge remote-tracking branch 'jlegan/master'
 In cases where AssemblyInfo is being preserved and there are multiple AssemblyInfo files present (very common in GitVersion implementations where there is a single common AssemblyInfo file containing version info and an AssemblyInfo file containing library specific details), AssemblyDetails will be null (multiple files not currently supported) but there is no null check in NuGetPackageTransformation. Added null propagation on the assemblyAttributes object. If time allows I will add support for multiple assemblyinfo files but at a minimum this fixes the null reference exception when assembly info details are being preserved.
