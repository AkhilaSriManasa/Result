 Re factoring of Language Services To Rely Less on Message Bus
 As I promised here is my re-factoring that I did to make language services less reliant on the appharbor/compilify.net web front end and backend worker message bus infrastructure.  Let me know of any problems you have with the code and I will try to address them before the pull request is accepted.

 Isn't Your Base32Encoder a Base36Encoder?
 I think you Base32Encoder is actually a Base36Encoder. Because you have the 26 characters of the alphabet plus the 10 numbers.

Base2 = 0 ... 1
Base8 = 0 ... 7
Base16 = 0 ... 9 A ... F
Base64 = 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z and equal (=) and slash (/)

Yours only goes

0 ... 9 a ... z

I know it doesn't really matter, just though I would point this out.
