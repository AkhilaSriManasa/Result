 #134 WIP GitHub Actions, Run on latest .NET Core SDK/macOS, new csproj, dotnet project structure

Still more work todo but need to commit so I can run on windows.
 Add dotnet core test app (#132)

* Update .gitignore

Add test log files to .gitignore

* Fix a .NET Core incompatibility with Delegate.BeginInoke

Fix a .NET Core incompatibility with Delegate.BeginInoke in TinyMessenger (see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/migrating-delegate-begininvoke-calls-for-net-core/).  Now all tests pass.

(cherry picked from commit b571041faab644518ae3aa08a0ce9a01e52a31f2)

* Multi-target tests to .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Core 2.1

Multi-target tests to .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Core 2.1. I wasn't able to find a way to use older versions (e.g., .NET Framework 4.0, as the original tests were built) and still get them to function in Visual Studio (16.5.4).

* Trim project files

Trim apparently unecessary project propeties in light of switch to
newer tools and frameworks. It would take some woirk to update
some of these if they are still needed (e.g, bootstrapper, etc).

 BUG: Child container unable to resolve open generic.

BUG: A child container was unable to resolve an open generic registered
with its parent container.
 Fix TinyIoCContainer.ResolveAll(Type resolveType) to include unnamed registration
 Fix compilation with PORTABLE symbol.

Compiling with the PORTABLE symbol results in several errors.

> The namespace 'TinyIoC' already contains a definition for
> 'ReverseTypeExtender'

The NETSTANDARD1_6 symbol is OR'd instead of AND'd. Since the rest of
the symbols are AND'd, this appears to be a copy-and-paste error.

> Inconsistent accessibility: parameter type 'BindingFlags' is less
> accessible than method 'TypeExtensions.GetConstructors(Type,
> BindingFlags)'

The BindingFlags enum is marked internal; however, it is included in
various public method signatures.
