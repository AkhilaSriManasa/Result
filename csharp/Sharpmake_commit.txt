 [Util] Added file copy readonly policy

Users now have some control over the readonly state of the destination
file when doing a file copy via `Util.ForceCopy`. Options are:
  - Preserve (default)
  - SetReadOnly
  - UnsetReadOnly
 Formatting
 Changes the behavior of DependencySetting.OnlyBuildOrder to add the target as a vcxproj project reference, or a prebuild dependency in FastBuild.
 - Fix hardcoded .dll extension, since it depends on the platform, we query it
- Fix target depends path
 Prevent writing empty sections in win64 vcxproj when toolchains are not overriden
 [Vcxproj|Linux] Fix LocalRemoteCopySources tag, should write true/false instead of Yes/No
 Create a base class for Apple platforms, and add iOS
 Fix generation of vs2019 when additionalVCTargetsPath is null
 Add a conf option to allow the generator to output full paths instead of relative paths.

For now only used by the csproj generator, for output and int paths.
 Adds support for whole archive in Linux.

* Adds support for --whole-archive and --no-whole-archive.
 Replace hard coded "REMOVE_LINE_TAG" by the FileGeneratorUtility one
 Add new utility extension method `GetVisualStudioVCRedistVersion`
 Add support for Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0
 Fixed discrepancy in how Sharpmake determines which projects to build between single and multithreaded modes (#76)

This led to cases where certain necessary projects were not being generated in multithreaded mode, leading to build failures

_buildScheduledType now acts as an accumulator of all project types to be generated, the contents of which is then added to Arguments.TypesToGenerate at the end of BuildProjectAndSolution

 [Android] Add "Latest" to the AndroidAPILevel option, that will allow sharpmake to auto-detect and set the latest api level found

Note that the SDK and/or NDK path must have been set for it to work. If none is found, it will reset to default.
 [Android] Change the way we do the override of MSBuild files with vs2017, in some cases the files from the local VS install were still used
