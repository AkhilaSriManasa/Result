 Resolving #302: DependsOnAsync tasks always show "Not Ran" 
 While fixing this bug, one idea popped up:

The tasks configured with `DependsOnAsync` method are actually executed with `Task.Run`, which is arguably not asynchronous calls. I mean the following code in TaskBase.cs:

```
protected virtual async Task<TResult> DoExecuteAsync(ITaskContextInternal context)
{
    return await Task.Run(() => DoExecute(context));
}
```

Having said that, I don't have better ideas to run those "Async" tasks simply because we don't know what those user-defined tasks really do (could be CPU-bound or I/O bound).

I'm just feel that `DependsOnAsync` might mislead people, make them think that those tasks are executed with C# asynchronous calls.
 
So one possible change is to rename `DependsOnAsync` to something else, maybe `DependsOnParallel` or `DependsOnConcurrently` ?

I may be wrong or missed something though. So this is just a note. No further action requested. (discussions are welcomed) 
 Resolving #299: obsolete warnings about IHostingEnvironment and IApplication…
 I know this issue is targeting milestone 6.0. 
However, I try to make the changes to support ASP.NET Core 2.x, 3.x, and ASP.NET 4.6.
One reason being that, even in FlubuCore v6, we might still need to support ASP.NET Core 2.x.
So I think maybe it can be merged to develop branch? Not sure though.
Please help me make the decision. If these changes should still go to milestone 6, I'll close this PR and create a new one targeting v6.

 There are 3 components left for update in the future:

- LiteDB

- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging 

Note for LiteDB: when update from v4 to v5, we might need to add `Connection=Shared` and `Upgrade=true` in connection string. (Some changes are preserved in branch [f283-update-dependent-packages-bak](https://github.com/huanlin/FlubuCore/tree/f283-update-dependent-packages-bak))
