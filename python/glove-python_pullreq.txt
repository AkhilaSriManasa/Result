 Solving #50
 This is a simple pull request for these two lines that I almost always must change whenever I'm using glove-python.
 New method to get the word vector representation
 This method turns using Glove easier to use in machine learning method that requires the vector representation.

Don't know if the name ```word_vector_by_word``` is the best name, please suggest me another if its a not a good one.
 added init_epoch to Glove.fit
 Each time that we called the fit method, the weights were randomly initiated, not allowing a warm start. Therefore, we just added a way to allow the model to resume the training.

 Add gensim dependency
 
 Added function return_word_vector(self,word)...
 ...to Glove class to retrieve vector from loaded model
example usage : 
glove_model=Glove.load('path/to/model')
glove_model.return_word_vector('physics')
 Update glove.py
 added if statement to check if the input word is duplicate or not.
 add support for exporting model to word2vec format
 Added support for exporting to .vec word2vec format that is the most
standardized non-binary format and allows for importing the vectors into
tools like gensim.

Added an accompanying example as well.
 fix to numpy not accepting dict keys/values iterators
 dict.keys() and values() returning special iterable types that numpy cannot iterate; this fixes the args passed to numpy so that they are ordinary iterable lists.
 Make number param behave predictably
 The number needs to be offset by 1 since the leading word (the input word) is stripped from the results.

 Call set_gcc function by default
 Do you call the set_gcc function by default for OSX user?

Because set_gcc is not called by default, some researchers who
are not familiar with python can not install glove-python.
 handles duplicated word in the output files generated by the C GloVe implementation
 For example, glove.840B.300d.

If model files have duplicated words, then reshape will raise error.

 Issue #45 (added missing submodule to setup).
 
 Add travis conf.
 
 Update changelog for 0.1.0 release.
 
 Update readme, add setup.cfg.
 
 Refactor co-occurrence matrix construction
 Plus some other changes to make the package more pypi-ready.

 Switch extensions for cythonize.
 
 Make sure c and cpp files are produced.
 
 Fix cythonize bug.
 
 Add tests for square error reproduction in the model fitting stage.
 
 Add an additional corpus construction test.
 
 Remove dep on Cython. Use pytest.
 
 added a random state to glove class
 While creating paragraph vectors I noticed that each initialization would be wildly different. This PR sets a `random_state` to the Glove class similar in spirit to those used in sklearn. Note that currently pre-trained models will have no random state set, and need to be set explicitly by the user.

 Out of core computation
 This PR allows out-of-core computation of both the co-occurrence matrix and word vectors by using memory-mapped numpy arrays.

This should result in memory usage constant in the size of the training corpus, at the cost of a performance penalty related to the amount of memory available and the speed of persistent storage used.

 Clip loss at maximum value
 To improve numerical stability.

 Read pre-trained word vectors
 
 Add a tracking of global loss in each epoch
 Something to look at while training the model :)

```
global_loss += 0.5 * entry_weight * (prediction - c_log(count)) **2
```

 Added a distance method to the Glove class
 Added a distance method to the Glove class to measure the distance between two arbitrary words.
I needed the functionality for my own project and thought it would be useful for this project as a whole.
Let me know if there are any other changes that may need to be done.

 Evaluation bugfixes
