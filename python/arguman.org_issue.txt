 [question] User authentication - SSO
 I have a website with a larger user database and I would like to use those existing accounts to authenticate against the Arguman user database. The goal is to only one website user account  and automatically beiing logged into Arguman website after log-in to the main website  . Are there any integration possibilities in Arguman in this regards?  

I've seen this article in regards to single sign on SSO, but it only mentions importing user from a list and no details are mentioned.

Thanks.

 Add a Polish translation
 This PR adds a translation of Arguman into Polish.

I had to remove a `pl` folder that contained strings in some other language - Portuguese, maybe? I can restore it under some other name, if necessary, but it didn't seem to be used anywhere, anyway.

If any further changes are needed to polish (pun not intended) the PR, please let me know.
dzięki! :)

deployed on https://pl.arguman.org/

Awesome, thanks! :)

I noticed, though, that Polish shows as "Polskie" in the list of languages on the live website, but it should be "Polski". I double-checked the code (`web/templates/base.html`) and it's "Polski" there, even here in the main repo (although wrapped in a probably unnecessary `{% trans %}`), so I'm slightly puzzled. Any idea why that happens?

It was my mistake, sorry! I was trying something on the production (off the record) 😶

It should be done now.

No worries! And thanks again :slightly_smiling_face: 

It could be awesome if you can send some initial arguments :) @fizyk20 

Btw, currently I am living in Poland as well. I will use this to practice my polish :)

> It could be awesome if you can send some initial arguments :)

I'll try, but TBH I don't really have ideas for arguments right now ;)

> Btw, currently I am living in Poland as well. I will use this to practice my polish :)

Haha, cool! :D

  X-Forwarded-For allows spoofing client IP address
 Hi,

"X-Forwarded-For" does not validate IP addresses given as headers. Ip addresses that saved in database, may not be real.

Thanks! :+1: :100: 
If I may chime in,

If you have more than one loadbalancer/proxy in your infrastructure, you will have the last one as REMOTE_ADDR, hence you shouldn't remove checking client ip by X-Forwarded-For

Say you have 

```
client -> CloudFront -> ALB -> Nginx -> web app
```

REMOTE_ADDR will be ALB - but X-Forwarded-For will contain the client's ip address. 

If you want to protect from spoofing X-Forwarded-For you need to remove it on your loadbalancer. Say for nginx, you can add something like.

```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
```

PS: HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR can be a list of ip addresses, but thats another issue :)


Thanks, master :)

 License issue: Switching GPL v3 to AGPL v3
 Hello,

Project's license is GNU GPL v3 now. GNU GPL is the best license for free software, except web applications. 

Arguman as a software running on web (server-side), the most appropriate license for Arguman is GNU AGPL v3 (or later). Because AGPL v3 is including some additional terms about softwares running on computer-network. 




bir version bump yapayım dedim, yeşillenmiş burası baya :)

How about BSD? @ybrs  reyiz dedi

There are several BSD licenses such as Simplified BSD License, 4-clause BSD License or 3-clause BSD License etc. First of all, we have to determine which one we are talking about.

BSD Licenses and their simulants have problems about conserving freedom. We call them as non-copyleft free software licenses. Before that, I think I should explain "copyleft" term.

Copyleft means conserving freedom as I said at the first sentence. If an output (output means any kind of human production here, e.g software, music, art, photo etc.) licensed with a copyleft license, the derivative works based on this output **have to** be free (**Free as in freedom**) as the original work. BSD Licenses or Expat/X11 License (erroneously people call this license as MIT License) don't have copyleft feature; so if you license your software with these licenses, a proprietary software developer can easily convert your software's license into a proprietary license or migrate your software into themselves software. Therefore, the software will be non-free, and also they use your code to grow their wallets and stealing people's freedom. With copylefted licenses, the derivatives of the work **must** licensed under the same license or another copyleft license. 

GNU GPL set the term "copyleft" at the very beginning of free software. On free software philosophy, the important topic is user's freedom. Richard M. Stallman thought that a free software should stay free, consequently users as well. 

But when we are talking about a web application, GNU GPL's copyleft can be insufficient. In GPL, you have to redistribute the source code with copies of software; but there comes a problem about web applications, because they are running on a server, not in our computers. GNU AGPL v3 was authored to solve this problem; if you run an AGPL'd software in a server (in other words if software is used over networks) you have to distribute the source code of it. 

But why we need this? I'll give an example on Arguman. With this license; if somebody fork Arguman and create a public Git repository, they must license their fork with the same license GPL v3 according to the conditions of it. But, if they add some extra code/features to Arguman and create a website called argument.cc or something like that, they don't have to distribute the source code. Because, they are running the software, **not you**. 

To resolve this problems, I **strongly recommend** to switch GNU AGPL v3 immediately. This license will protect our software from vultures of proprietarians. BSD Licenses or Expat/X11/MIT Licenses, generally non-copyleft licenses only strong non-free software and it's adherents.

Done

 Change confusing "open source" expression to "free/libre software", add license information to README
 Hello,

The term "open source" is not appropriate for this project. The term should be "free/libre software".

Also license information added to README files.

Thanks!

 Python3 support
 Do you have plans for this? I can fork and start porting.

But in this case many deprecated package  needs to be replaced with alternatives such as django-social-auth etc...

Some legacy test would be useful. xD 


 Arguman doesn't recognize psycopg2 module on Ubuntu.
 TItle says it all. Here's my terminal output. Installed psycopg2 from pip, sudo pip, and apt.

**tl;dr -- I did three separate installs of `psycopg2`, but `arguman_web` doesn't recognize any of them**

 Request: Export function
 If there's any way to setup a function to allow exporting of arguments (e.g. to PDF or image) that would be a useful function e.g., for educators who want to see evidence that students have created some form of map in an assignment. I think some tools let you export the maps themselves (I guess some xml) which might be nice in the future. Thanks
Simon
 Idea: Bulk upload user lists (or, google SSO)
 Hey
I'm planning to use the tool with a class of students, and rather than getting them to signup, I'd really like to be able to upload a list of IDs to create usernames for them (or, to use our google apps logins to link accounts). 
Thanks!
Simon
 Similar open-source debating software
 Hello all!

For the past year, I've been working on a website very similar to Arguman. It's open-source as well, and hosted here on Github. (https://github.com/Venryx/DebateMap)

Recently, someone contacted me and made me aware of a similar project called "Gruff Debates". (https://words.democracy.earth/introducing-project-gruff-830127de1bb6)

I since joined their Slack channel, and have been pleased to be able to talk with them daily and get feedback as we share updates on our (currently separate) projects. We may merge them in the future, but at the moment we are experimenting with different layouts and designs.

It got me thinking that the Arguman developers might be interested in joining our conversation there. We're currently discussing a few different questions, including:
* What database solution to use to store the debate contents -- claims, arguments, votes. (Currently, Debate Map uses Firebase, while Gruff uses PostgreSQL, but we're thinking of perhaps switching to a graph database.)
* How to display arguments -- as simple nodes, or as "formal arguments" with two or more premises.
* How to handle and display voting -- whether voting should be used for two separate components of "truth" and "relevance", etc.

Anyhow, it would be cool to get more input on these questions, from developers of an already-active debating website.

If any of you are interested, here's an invite link to our Slack server:

Looking forward to seeing you there!

 Little fix
 
 Add spanish version
 
💃

 Don't truncate text when going over the character limit
 When adding a premise, for instance:

http://en.arguman.org/semi-colons-are-unnecessary-in-javascript/premises/28292/new

… there is a 300 character limit, and when you hit it, you can't type anymore. A better UI would be to allow the user to type more, but indicate that they are over the limit, and not allow posting until they get it back under. This allows getting your full thought out and then trimming throughout the piece to fit the limit. This is how Twitter handles its character limit, and it's much more user-friendly than simply disallowing further typing.
I see you've updated this and closed it; does that mean it's been fixed? :-)

 Hardcoded Google Analytics tracking
 I didn't find this discussed anywhere before - if I missed something, please let me know.

argüman seems to include hardcoded Google Analytics code:

https://github.com/arguman/arguman.org/blob/8b1b8ffcb7f8af9bd30a780eee5a8a82e5095cd9/web/templates/base.html#L94-L101

While this *might* be okay for a publicly hosted instance, making everyone hosting their own instance "phone home" to your(?) Google Analytics account really isn't nice.

This should arguably be opt-in, but at the very least, there should be a way to disable it (and maybe to customize the ID).

disclaimer: I've not self-hosted argüman before - this was noticed in a (non-public) mailinglist conversation, and the solution taken there was running a custom fork of the project removing the tracking code.
Arguman hasn't been developed with multiple instances in mind. I've been
working on it, see some hanging PRs, but without bigger community it won't
be launched. Bring those people from private mailing list space here.

 #365 Missing premises migrations
 Fixes #365 
Thank you for your contribution. 

 Missing premises migrations
 There are some missing migrations in `premises`
 #350 If there are no featured arguments show most crowded arguments
 If there are no featured arguments the page is empty.

It would be good to show there something, for example the most crowded arguments.
 Create reviewers team
 There is hardly any community-building work happening right now in this repository. There are hanging 16 PRs and 140 issues. I totally understand that in volunteering projects such as Arguman it is very often hard to commit to it a lot of time. There are ways to remedy that though.

I propose to create an official github team called reviewers, lieutenants, moderators, strategists or whatever codename you like the most, who would commit to answer issues, review PRs, merge them, etc.  It's a good practice to have a team like this and processes for handling PRs such as "at least two members have to accept PR for it to be accepted to merge; any doubts should be clarified before merging".

It may be necessary to create several teams, one for UX, other for logic and language matters, but for starters one should do.

@fatiherikli @bahattincinic @halilkaya @livacengiz @vargi @ybrs @onurmatik @cangoktas @hmert - what do you think?
