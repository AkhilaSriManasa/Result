 setup.py: Use OR to indicate MIT or Apache-2.0 (#79)

Using `/` is not ambiguous, however `or` is more clear
and is syntax recognised by packaging tools.
 Add decorator to tests which require internet connection. (#59)

* Add decorator to tests which require internet connection.

Pip from version 10.0.0 implemented support for pyproject.toml
files (PEP 518) which means that pip now installs build
dependencies automatically which doesn't work without internet.

* fixup! Add decorator to tests which require internet connection.

Why is the max_depth set to 3? 

Each iteration is quite fast. I'd say we don't need the max_depth or it would be nice to set it to some ungodly number like 50.

Tbh, I don't have a real use case/technical reason. Though, as a user it feels a bit intrusive to recurse the entire tree looking for a file. It just seems harder to reason about and could cause issues for monorepos.

We could add an env var like pipenv does if you want?

My concern is a user might be in one of the sub-directories of a project (which can be 5 directories deep) and run `hatch install requests`. That might fail because we're unable to detect the project root 3 levels up. 

Plus this traversal is a linear traversal where we go one level up and check until we encounter pyproject.toml or setup.py. We don't do a tree traversal where we try to descend to every sub-directory in an attempt to find the root. 

So I'd prefer we set this value to at least 10. The env var can be added but the default should be a reasonable number (10).

 for now
