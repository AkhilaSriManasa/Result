 Add a Polish translation
 This PR adds a translation of Arguman into Polish.

I had to remove a `pl` folder that contained strings in some other language - Portuguese, maybe? I can restore it under some other name, if necessary, but it didn't seem to be used anywhere, anyway.

If any further changes are needed to polish (pun not intended) the PR, please let me know.
 şifre değil parola
 Correct Turkish translations by changing "şifre" to "parola"
  X-Forwarded-For allows spoofing client IP address
 Hi,

"X-Forwarded-For" does not validate IP addresses given as headers. Ip addresses that saved in database, may not be real.

Thanks! :+1: :100: 
 Change confusing "open source" expression to "free/libre software", add license information to README
 Hello,

The term "open source" is not appropriate for this project. The term should be "free/libre software".

Also license information added to README files.

Thanks!

 Little fix
 
 Add spanish version
 
 #365 Missing premises migrations
 Fixes #365 
 #350 If there are no featured arguments show most crowded arguments
 If there are no featured arguments the page is empty.

It would be good to show there something, for example the most crowded arguments.
 Fix #347 Settingify default view
 Allow default view to be the list view, fixes #347 
 Fix #351 Make adding channels easier
 Changelog:
- showing channels bar on homepage for admins even if there are no channels
- added + sign (with WCAG message) on a channels bar to link to channel creation
- Channel's language is a mandatory field now
- Channel's and Noun's language is prefilled with current language
- Channel's order field has been hidden and drag-and-drop interface has been introduced by adminsortable2 library
- New translation: Hint for Channel's is_featured has been added
- WCAG "hide element" classes been added to css
 Add contributing documentation and update install instructions
 That PR solves #329 #330 #304
 Create django.po
 Bsed on Jorge's great work im here trying to add my continuation to the translations for a spanish: es_locale

 duplicate ugettext_lazy as _
 
 Search by slug has been added in Argument api
 Related: #309 

 WIP: Add Romanian translation support
 This change aims to introduce Romanian translation support. It's still WIP at this point. I got most of the po file done but I want to test it, see how it looks on a local environment and get some reviews about the logical translations. 

 Add downloading of textblob data in Dockerfile
 This step was missing to make a functional Docker container.

 Add missing networkx dependency in requirements.txt
 arguman wouldn't start with docker-compose without this change.

 postgres driver should be optional
 Details on #305 

 only redirect to translated page if the site is configured to do so
 This resolves an issue whereby the `PREVENT_LANGUAGE_REDIRECTION` setting would allow users to create new arguments, but all attempts to view detail pages would redirect to non-existent translation pages.

 add missing setup step to download corpora in web container
 
 add missing python networkx requirement
 
 Typo fixed for new premise screen
 
 Update fallacies.json
 Most of the global logic community calls the fallacy "post hoc ergo propter hoc", shortened to either "post hoc fallacy" or "causalation". I know you're based in the Turkish-speaking community and all, but I never see "previous this" unless it's adjacent to its Turkish name and usually also the Latin name familiar to logicians around the world. And on the Anglophone-facing version of the site it is best to reflect a universal consensus on the name.
