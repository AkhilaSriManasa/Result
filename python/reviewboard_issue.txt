 About 3.0.6
 Hi, when I commit a review request, I specify the reviewer people ping.ni, but another people jun.he can ship it. I do not know why, can you give me the answer. 
Thank you for your attention.

You probably wanted to post to our [community support list](https://groups.google.com/group/reviewboard/pendmsg), not open a pull request.

The short answer is that the Reviewers list is for specifying people you want to review your code, but does not restrict reviews to those users. We provide an inclusive model where anyone with feedback can contribute to the review process. Companies that want to restrict things can lock down with private repositories, invite-only groups, or extensions that alter the review behavior (this is a more advanced capability).

 Patch for ticket 4009
 Changed default value for branch as the None value will be inserted to MySQL if it's not sent when creating a review. I tried this change on our server and it looks to fix the null exception.

This is to try and solve the ticket 4009

Thanks for posting this. However, we don't accept pull requests (we do our code reviews on https://reviews.reviewboard.org).

We're going to be reverting the patch that caused this issue and releasing 2.5.2 later tonight.

Sorry for the inconvenience.


ok, as long as it starts working I'm ok with it :)

 Restore the extensions documentation for 1.7.
 We moved the extensions docs out of the codebase docs, but this left 1.7
users with no way to get to the new docs. This restores the old docs,
but under the 1.7 manual.

We don't accept pull requests, but I don't understand the point of this pull request anyway. Extension documentation for 2.0 is already in the correct location for the 2.0 manual (under the Extending Review Board section), and the old docs for 1.7 were already restored.

 Hi!

Please add latest Diff timestamp. Review last activity does not represent Diff activity. It is good to know if the 
diff was updated last.

We don't accept pull requests. Please post contributions to https://reviews.reviewboard.org/

 (enhancement) allow management commands inside RB extensions
 Now rbsite picks up management commands only from installed applications, i.e. rbsite doesn't take extensions into account. To fix it, rbsite can load all extensions before generating list of management commands.

 add custom "X-ReviewRepository" email header containing repository name; useful for filtering
 **Description:**

Our RB instance has many repositories and I like to have email filters to divide my incoming requests into sub-folders.  Having filters based on headers instead of the contents of the message is preferable.

I'm happy to change the header name to something else.  "X-ReviewBoard-Repository" maybe?

**Testing Done:**

Visual.

 Change max value of hosting_url to 255
 The current value (256) makes the size of the row too big for MySQL InnoDB engine, resulting in this error:

django.db.utils.DatabaseError: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes

As the RFC (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) fix this value to 255 as bigger, and it is enough to avoid the issue with InnoDB, it would be great to change it.

Thank you in advance.

 Fix a major boo-boo in the 1.7.7 release
 The port being an integer blows up as the regex expects a string resulting in a TypeError.

When _not_ specifying the port via rb-site install, it blows up.

``` python
* Installing the site...
Building site directories ... OK
Building site configuration files ... Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/venvs/bin/rb-site", line 8, in <module>

```

I verified this patch works as expected with the port. For kicks, I added a cast to str for the site_id, but that is just for good measure. The port is what blows up for me.

My invocation of rb-site:

``` bash
rb-site install \
  --copy-media \
  --noinput \
  --domain-name="${vhost}.${domain}" \
  --site-root=/ \
  --static-url=static/ \
  --media-url=media/ \
  --db-type=mysql \
  --db-name="$database" \
  --db-host=localhost \
  --db-user="$team" \
  --db-pass="$password" \
  --cache-type=memcached \
  --cache-info="localhost:11211" \
  --web-server-type=apache \
  --python-loader=wsgi \
"${basedir}/$vhost"
```

 Be able to select both versions of diff to compare to
 The itch that I wanted to scratch was that it was impossible when looking at diff 3, to look between the diffs 1 and 2 without needing a double refresh (or some intimate URL knowledge).

Didn't want to change too much at the start, since I was unfamiliar with the project. Based on the feedback I got from the review I ended up changing a little bit more: I merged the "Jump to revision" and the "Changes between rX and" buttons.

Looks a lot cleaner. Anyway, check the review for some screenshots:

 Make Chrome wrap very long lines with no spaces
 Chrome does not currently wrap very long lines with no spaces (though
Firefox does).

This makes the diff view unusable since one such line will cause all
other long lines to also not break, even if they do have spaces. The
result is that  you have to scroll to read every line that is longer than
what fits in the split diff view.

(I agree that in a perfect world all code would be hard-wrapped at
80 characters, and there would be no long lines without spaces.)
