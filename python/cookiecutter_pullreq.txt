 feat: don't call Popen for python hooks
 I want to run cookiecutter with untrusted templates.

One way to do it is run cookiecutter in a sandbox environment such as the the ones in pypy, jython and ironpython.   In such sandbox, I can prevent the untrusted template from modifying files outside the generated project.

The challenge is that the hooks are invoked using subprocess.Popen.  Sandboxes cannot allow Popen, because the child process would escape the sandbox. 

This PR uses python's exec to run the hook code within the same process and remain sandboxed.

Note the tests don't pass because some of the tests invoke sys.exit(1),  which just exits cookiecutter itself.  Looking for feedback for ways to solve this.
 
 Fixed: Replaced no longer maintained pipsi by pipx
 Pipsi is no longer maintained (from the [pipsi github page](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/)).
 Changed: README.md PyPI URLs changed to the modern PyPI last version
 
 Fixed: Comma in README.md
 Closes #1389 
 MANIFEST: Fix file name extensions
 The files got new file name extensions, but MANIFEST was not updated -> files were missing in the tarballs
 Remove support for python2.7
 Python 2.7 is officially dead and we are not going to make any new release that supports it.

This removes py27 code but a follow-up will address other changes like removing use of `six`.

Major version is bumped to 1.8.0 to mark this breaking change.
 Fixed: Jinja2&Six version limits causing build errors with ansible project (#1384)

 Prepare release 1.7.1
 
 readme: document specific topics
 Documents how template authors can use github topics to make
their templates easily discoverable by others.

Note: many of these topics do not have any entries because template authors did not know about this. Still, to avoid a chick-n-egg issue, we start by documenting them first. Later we can ping some of them to ask them to update their github topics based on the documentation.
