Updated AIY-projects-python directory as written [here](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/blob/aiyprojects/HACKING.md#python-library) with `sudo pip3 uninstall protobuf` ` sudo pip3 install protobuf==3.5.2`.

 Create voice3aplushack.md
 Sorry it's a pretty rough submit. Just jot down thoughts.

11-16-18 AIY image is the latest image, and the only image late enough to support the new 3A+ released also in November 2018. Unfortunately that particular image, I've encounter many audio playback issues, some microphone issues also. There would be no sound which I suspect has something to do with pulseaudio that was introduced with August 2018 AIY image. The most recent AIY image that worked as expected was 4-13-18, but unfortunately does not support futureware 3A+. 3A+ would not boot unless with November 2018 the latest AIY image.

Therefore I experimented by downloading the most recent Raspbian image from raspberrypi.org 11-13-18 to ensure that 3A+ would boot. From there I followed the hacking.md guide from google/aiy-raspbian to proceed to add setup AIY voice with src files from 4-13-18 the version that did not include pulseaudio and worked fine. Along with minor changes to configuration files as you will see.

My experiment worked. 3A+ was able to boot, play audio from the v1 voice hat.

I suspect pulseaudio to be the culprit. Additionally, the script folder with install-alsa and install-services with asound.conf seem to disappear from the most recent image. These were found in the 4-13-18 AIY image src/scripts.

Happy hacking!

 Add scope parameter for Cloud Speech

 Fix a potential UnboundLocalError in tests
 ```python
name = 'hotdog.jpg'

    @contextmanager
    def TestImage(name):
        try:
            f = open(test_image_path(name), 'rb')
            try:
                image = Image.open(f)
                yield image
            finally:
                image.close()
        finally:
>           f.close()
E           UnboundLocalError: local variable 'f' referenced before assignment
```
Using the context manager will always do the work for us :)

The same error could happen  for `image`, fixed in the same time.
 Add set_brightness function to LED driver
 This makes it possible for voice kit to have a night mode where the LED is dimmer during certain hours by calling `aiy.voicehat.get_led().set_brightness(10)`

This feature was requested by @mpember in #283 and credit for the code goes to him and @drigz who suggested it.
 Add soundcard setup in HACKING.md
 The HACKING file doesn't have instructions for setting up the soundcard. Without the setup, the soundcard won't be found or set as the default soundcard.

#210 #261 
 Add missing dependency to setup.py
 Currently if you follow the instructions in HACKING.md to install Assistant, you will end up with a broken install. When you try to run any of the demos, you will get an error because the dependency `google-auth-oauthlib` is missing. This was formerly listed as a dependency in the `requirements.txt` file when there was one, I think it still needs to be there in `setup.py`.
 Update bpm calculation at toneplayer.py

 Voicekit - a problem about bluetooth
 Hello! I am a student who wants to develop some user interfaces using Bluetooth.
I installed several python modules to take advantage of Bluetooth.
-sudo apt-get install bluetooth libbluetooth-dev
-sudo pip install pybluez
-sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
-sudo pip install gattlib
However, some errors occurred when installing the above module.

Are there any precautions for using Bluetooth module?
I want to communicate Bluetooth between raspberry pie.
Is there a Bluetooth module already installed and usable?

Thank you!!
 Add explanation for when error 403 happens
 Addressing #321 by making it more clear what the issue (probably) is.
 Include vision for led import
 Changing `aiy.leds` to `aiy.vision.leds`. This change has been made across multiple of the example scripts in this repo. The original code loaded on the Vision kit includes:

`from aiy.vision.leds import Leds` 

 Fix ImportError
 The module name for leds is wrong, causing "ImportError: No module named 'aiy.leds'" error.
This is fixed by changing "aiy.leds" to "aiy.vision.leds".

 Fixing LED deadlock
 ## Description

During the LED cleanup process, a deadlock occurs as illustrated below. In this example, Thread A is the main thread which calls `LED.stop()`, and Thread B is the animate thread, held by `self.animator`.

1. `LED.stop()` is called by Thread A.
2. Thread A acquires the lock ([L69](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/blob/aiyprojects/src/aiy/_drivers/_led.py#L69))
3. It joins with Thread B, without releasing the lock. ([L72](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/blob/aiyprojects/src/aiy/_drivers/_led.py#L72))
4. Thread B waits for the lock, before being able to terminating. ([L87](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/blob/aiyprojects/src/aiy/_drivers/_led.py#L87))

This was reproduced in Python 3.5.3.

 Also install google-assistant-library on armv6l
 I'm running a raspberry pi zero w (arm6l). I've done all the setup steps. 
When running the example scripts, the `google-assistant-library` was missing. So I installed it the same way like in the install-deps.sh does it for ARMv7 and it works fine. So this I guess it's not only available on v7 but on v6?
 Run check_audio in python env
 The documented command is missing the env and this is what happend:  

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "checkpoints/check_audio.py", line 27, in <module>
    import aiy.audio  # noqa
ImportError: No module named 'aiy'
```

I changed it to the command that can be found in `shortcuts/check_audio.desktop`
 Add deprecation warning to voicekit/HACKING.md
 
 Update HACKING.md
 Corrected defaulted co directory
 Update example script path in HACKING.md
 The path `src/assistant_library_demo.py` is obsolete, and no longer works in the aiyprojects branch. This PR fixes that in HACKING.md.
