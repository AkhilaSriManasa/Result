 Fix typographical error(s)
 @egirault, I've corrected a typographical error in the documentation of the [googleplay-api](https://github.com/egirault/googleplay-api) project. Specifically, I've changed catagories to categories. You should be able to merge this pull request automatically. However, if this was intentional or if you enjoy living in linguistic squalor, please let me know and [create an issue](https://github.com/thoppe/orthographic-pedant/issues/new) on my home repository.

 added requirements.txt
 
 add proxies and fix bug in list more and more apps
 add proxies in config.py and googleplay.py

 Don't crash when no results are returned
 Searching for strings that return no results crashes.

 Feature/reviews
 Added a CLI script to fetch reviews for a given package.

 Fix for list() method when run with integer inputs
 I've changed the sanitization method for the nb_results and offset parameters of the GooglePlayAPI.list() method from requests.utils.quote() to int().  The quote function causes issues with integer inputs - doesn't look like it was an issue when running via command line, but shows up if you call the function manually with integer inputs.

 Added a setup.py
 Can now be installed with either the following:

python setup.py install

or

pip install -e <path-to-project>

 Enable packaged installation using setup.py
 This also removes the dependency on config.py from googleplay.py. The
reason for that is because GooglePlayAPI constructor already accepts
values for the fields being obtained via `config.py`, and only the driver
wrapper scripts pass in those values from `config.py`.

By removing `config.py` dependency, it allows the package to be installed
via `easy_install`, which will only install the `googleplay` and
`googleplay_pb2` modules to the system, avoiding the need to introduce any
of the other scripts.

 ProtoBuf definitions for checkins
 These are some other checkin protobufs that were missing from the main file. Maybe they should be separated. Also, they should probably be compiled. These commits are based on top of my packaging branch, which allows googleplayapi to be installed in different projects.

 Packaging
 Makes all this code accessible from other projects as a python egg. Also, googleplayapi could be submitted to PyPi at some point.

 Switch from urllib2 to python-requests
 Here's what's in here:
- Switch from urllib2 to python-requests (hooray!)
- pep8, formatting, whitespace, tab crusading, dos2unix
- Move copied functions into a shared file
- Make the config file complain loudly (but honestly this needs to be refactored completely, why is there a config file in a library anyway)
- basic `.gitignore`
- other things

 Fixed bug in api login response
