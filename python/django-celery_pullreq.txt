 Foolproof prevention via strict tuples. Fixes #573
 In 3.3.0 [options were broken](5d1ecb09c6304d22cc447c7c08fba0bd1febc2ef) by messing up tuples and lists
 Fixed #560: Type casting preload_options to list.
 Fixed #560 
 Run management command in tox.
 Run the `celery` management command, to detect breakage there.

This should be more exaustive (though I'm not sure which commands will work with the celery config here?), it should be enough to check if the management command fails.

This is to try and detect bugs like #573 

It looks like there have been similar bugs recently in the tracker too.

~~NOTE:  **I can't run tox here to see if this works.**~~

This fails in tox, so seems to be correct.

 Fix bug when run command `celery`
 There's a bug when run `python manage celery` related to attribute `preload_options` not existed in `CeleryCommand`.
 Improve translation notes in the FAQ
 Update FAQ to demonstrate `translation.override` instead of `translation.activate` for switching language inside a task. The override function is safer and simpler.
 Update celery.py

 Add tox to test requirements
 This project requires tox to run tests, and Django should be included as default.
 Version in readme has not been updated
 Found it misleading, highest version in pip is 3.2.2
 Add natural key support to the PeriodicTask model.
 Needed for dumpdata/loaddata to work properly.
 Support celerycam for reconnecting db connenction if db connection is lost accidentally
 Currently if the database is not stable and connection is lost, celerycam can not reconnect db connection automatically and it can not work properly anymore. The error ```connection already closed``` will always be raised.

This PR supports to automatically reconnect db connection for celerycam if db connection is lost.
 Fix incorrect display of html form with Django 2.0

 Bump version to 3.2.2
 edx-platform will temporarily use this edX fork of django-celery until Celery is upgraded to v4.
edx-platform currently installs django-celery v3.2.1. That version was *not* on master in the upstream repo - it was on an unmerged branch:
https://github.com/celery/django-celery/compare/master...v3.2.1

This PR bumps the version on the edX fork to avoid confusion around the installation of django-celery. Bumping the version will cause installation of the edX fork version on all edx-platform installations.

 Improves periodic tasks admin, tasks are better clickable.
Old situation: only `enabled` is clickable. This is not clear because it uses an icon.

New situation, `periodic task` and `task name` are also clickable. This improves navigation in the periodic task admin:
