 Bump version to 1.1.2.
 Normalize IP addresses and change error to warning

All IP addresses passed to `dev_addr` are now normalized.
`127.000.000.001` is normalized to `127.0.0.1`.

With apologies to docker container users, the address `0.0.0.0`
no longer raises an error but a warning instead. Apparently,
docker containers need to use that address, even in dev environments.

Closes #2108.
 Bump version to 1.1.1.
 Flake8 cleanup.

It appears that the latest version of flake8 caught a couple more things.
 Make compressed sitemap deterministic (#2100)
 Fix markdownlint test (#2095)

Travis only gives us Node.js version 8 so we must use an older
version of markdownlint. To declare a newer node.js version we
lose the ability to have Python as the lang and install tox.
If/when the default node version gets updated, remove the
version restriction on markdownlint.
 Use README.md as index.html when use_directory_urls is false
 Ignore links which start with a backslash.

Fixes #1680.
 Pass builder to on_serve event.

Every call to `server.watch` requires `builder` to be passed in. If
users are to add their own watched files, then they need access to
`builder`. Fixes #1952.
 Remove deprecated theme_dir option from CLI.

This should have been removed some time ago. Fixes #2042.
 Set dependency to `lunr[languages]
Lunr.py version 0.5.8 maintains compatability with Lunr.js 2.3.8, but
restricts its dependnecy to nltk>=3.2.5,<3.5, which avoids installation
issues on some Docker images. Fixes #2062.
 Fix typo
 Remove disable_unicode_literals_warning config
 Correct error message

Fixes #2009
 Update docs to reflect supported versions.
 Fix readthedocs code colors

Fixes #2027.
 Add minimum search length configuration parameter.

Allow users to set their own minimum search term length.  Fixes #2014.
 Clean up `dev_addr` validation and disallow `0.0.0.0`

MkDocs has never supported using the included server for production.
However, some users have been using it that way. This would prevent that.

We also actually validate IP addresses now.
 Ensure bdist_wheel no longer creates a universal wheel

MkDocs no longer suports Python 2. Therefore, a universal wheel would be
innapropriate as it results in `py2.py3`.
 Correct the block name of the search box in the doc

As mentionned here: https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1142#issuecomment-282899537
I just correct the name in the documentation
 Use type search for search input

doesn't make a difference to how it works but is more semantically correct.
 Fix a minimum dependency description

Markdown package require 3.2.1 at mkdocs 1.1
 Bump version to 1.1
 Ensure lunr.py version matches lunr.js

Each version of lunr.py only works with a specific version of lunr.js.
Therefore we must hardcode the specific version of lunr.py in our
requirements. As we recently updated to lunr.js version 2.3.8 (#1995),
that coincides with lunr.py version 0.5.6. See the lunr.py CHANGELOG for
coinciding versions: https://github.com/yeraydiazdiaz/lunr.py/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
 Fix simple typo: seperate -> separate

Closes #1997
 Put the mobile menu button for the mkdocs theme on the right

This behavior matches MkDocs 1.0 as well as the examples on the Bootswatch
site.
 Nested dropdowns *are* supported in the mkdocs theme

Despite Bootswatch not supporting nested dropdowns, the theme-specific CSS for
the mkdocs theme does add support for it, so we can remove the warning from
the release notes.
 Update to lunr.js 2.3.8; resolves #1989
 Fix indent width in mkdocs/themes/mkdocs/css/base.css
 Update to lunr-languages v1.4.0; resolves #1729

This renames the Dutch language code to `nl`, the Japanese code to `ja`, and
adds support for Arabic (`ar`) and Vietnamese (`vi`).
