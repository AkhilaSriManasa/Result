 fix bug when sec-websocket-protocol and sec-websocket-extensions appear in header
While this change does address the simple failure case of one protocol, it still does not properly handle the case where the client is created with an array of protocol values (same for extensions).

A more correct change is:

```                protocols.extend([x.strip() for x in value.split(b',')])```

This fix is is included in Pull Request #219.

Good catch. When Iooked at it yesterday, I sort of recalled this could be a case but not quite sure. I do not use this project myself and I must admit I didn't clearly remember the details. I probably should have been more careful.

 Adds argument to set block value on gevent get command in WebSocketClient.receive()
 Rudimentary fix and testcase for Issue #179

Per RFC-6455 protocols and extensions values can contain multiple
values and may occur multiple times in the header.
This fix handles only the case of the ',' delimiter and not ';'.
Enhanced existing test to verify the most basic of parsing examples.
 Minor cleanup of client code, unused imports, typo, and comments
