 Add git submodule manual steps
 Alleviates #5
 Manual build instructions skip submodule step
 Using a fresh clone of 8c583ca the manual steps don't work:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
CMake Error at test/CMakeLists.txt:4 (add_subdirectory):
  The source directory
    /home/nick/dev/libz32/test/lib/googletest
  does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/nick/dev/libz32/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
```

Looking a the `build-and-run` script it's missing the submodule checkout step for the googletest library:

`run "git submodule init && git submodule update"`

Will make a PR in a sec.
 Update README.md
 In the current version of Clion build project and install are both contained under the Build menu.
 convert to GitHub template
 
 CLion doesn't have Run -> Install option
 Maybe I'm just stupid and looking into the wrong menu, but the [README.md](https://github.com/kigster/cmake-project-template/blob/master/README.md#building-in-clion) says the following:

> Select menu option **Run ➜ Build**, and then **Run ➜ Install**.

However, those are the only options shown when I open the project for the first time:

I got the application running after some clicking around, so I just wanted to give a heads up and suggest to change this part of the readme.
README says **Build → Build Project**, and **Build → Install**.

 Fix unit test compile error
 
Thanks!
