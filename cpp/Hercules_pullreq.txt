 Remove misleading debug code for nonexistent skill unit group when ending SC_DANCING
 ### Pull Request Prelude

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

In 00be89f `skill_stop_dancing()` was removed and its code moved to `status_change_end_()`.
When moving the code the `NULL` pointer check for the skill unit group was dropped which led to server crashes. ([Bug report.](https://herc.ws/oldboard/tracker/issue-3504-skill-delunitgroup-crashing-map-server-again/?gopid=3504#entry3504))
To track down the issue some debug code was added in 590cab6 and f41e10d.
Finally in 8aee60e the `NULL` pointer check was added back but the debug code wasn't removed which caused misleading debug messages until today.

To "fix" this, the ancient debug code should be removed.

 Fix left shift of negative value for GN_CRAZYWEED_ATK
 ### Pull Request Prelude

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

Pass `0` for `type` instead of `-1` when calling `skill_addtimerskill()` for `GN_CRAZYWEED`.
This value is later used to retrieve the skill's unit ID at the given index so `0` is the correct value for `GN_CRAZYWEED` since it has only one unit ID.

 Hercules Ultimate Storage System

### Changes Proposed

## Design

Implementation of the Hercules Ultimate Storage System
Storages can now be created through a configuration file that describes their attributes.
Example storage configuration:
    
```
{
        Id: (int)                              (required|unique) Unique Identifier
        Name: (string)                         (required) Name of the storage sent to the client.
        Capacity: (int)                        (required) Maximum capacity of the storage.
}
```

Additional storages are handled with dynamic arrays that will save a tonne of memory when created, as opposed to a design in which they were implemented using fixed length arrays. In simple terms, a storage of 600 items would approximately cost the same amount of memory as 600 storages with 1 item each.
They are saved in the same storage database (SQL) as the original separating them by a storage identifier.
An infinite number of storages can be created, there are no limits.
The current design implementation only allow saving/loading of approximately 1600 items per storage due to packet size limits.
    
PS. Make sure you apply SQL upgrades for this patch!

## Access Modes

Storage access modes can be set through the `openstorage` builtin command.

```
	STORAGE_ACCESS_VIEW     // View storage only
	STORAGE_ACCESS_GET      // Allow getting items from storage.
	STORAGE_ACCESS_PUT      // Allow putting items to storage.
	STORAGE_ACCESS_ALL      // Allow all actions.
```

Default storage mode : STORAGE_ACCESS_ALL

## Script Commands

Changed: `openstorage(<storage_id>{, <storage_mode>})`

### Changes Proposed

Since it's kind of expectable to occasionally be unable to retrieve the target's `block_list` by its ID in `unit_steptimer()`, the `NULL` pointer report should be replaced with returning an error code.

 Fix condition for deleting skill units when unloading NPC

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

Currently it's almost impossible to fulfil the condition for calling `skill_clear_unitgroup()` in `npc_unload()` since `nd->ud` always is `NULL` or `&npc->base_ud` if `unit_bl2ud2()` was never called for the NPC's block_list (for example by `npcspeed()`).
I changed the condition to only check for `nd->ud != NULL` to ensure that all skill units belonging to the unloaded NPC are deleted.

- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

This PR adds some robustness to the code related to `skill_get_index()` and fixes some wrong assumptions and dangerous index arithmetic index in the Bard/Dancer Soul Link temporarily granted skills, reported in #2670 .

Warnings have been added, to help detecting incorrectly defined ranges for `skill_get_index()`.

Finally, the use of the `SKILL_FLAG_REPLACED_LV_0` value (and in general, values from `enum e_skill_flag`) have been sanitized, since suspicion on them was raised in a private report about attempts to save negative skill indexes to the database (which may or may not have been a secondary effect of the Bard/Dancer granted skills issue).

 Implement SC_RESIST_PROPERTY_* and icon display for SC_ARMOR_RESIST
 ### Pull Request Prelude

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

I was told that the changes made in #2614 have no effect because of a missing implementation of the `SC_RESIST_PROPERTY_*` status changes. Well, that's true. :grin:
I have to admin that I didn't check this. Sorry. But even if they had fully been implemented, affecting 1 element for each status change would have led to problems anyway.
Because the 4 *proof Potions (12118-12121) and Undead Elemental Scroll (12279) share the same status changes and icons, they'd unpredictably influence each other. For example mutual status change negation or icon removal due to different duration.

My implementation of the  `SC_RESIST_PROPERTY_*` status changes is based on the *proof Potions and affects 2 elements each.
I added icon display to `SC_ARMOR_RESIST` and use it in the Undead Elemental Scroll's script again.

Now comes the tricky part. No one could tell me how these items interact with each other in official servers.
Will using Undead Elemental Scroll cancel all *proof Potion effects?
Will using a *proof Potion be canceled if the Undead Elemental Scroll's effect is active or will it cancel the scroll's effect partially or even completely? Who knows...
In commit 686c575 I added dynamic icon applying/removing/re-applying to have each element's icon is only displayed if its corresponding resistance is greater than 0. For the calculation only values of `SC_RESIST_PROPERTY_*` and `SC_ARMOR_RESIST` are used. Other item or skill effects won't affect it.
I know this solution isn't perfect, so feel free to provide alternatives or official information.

 Cap string variable value length and unify corresponding SQL columns size
 ### Pull Request Prelude

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

Currently the maximum length of string variable values is inconsistent.
 * If a variable is not stored in a SQL table its value's length is not restricted.
 * If a variable is stored in `acc_reg_str_db`, `char_reg_str_db` or `global_acc_reg_str_db` table its value's length is restricted to 254.
 * If a variable is stored in `mapreg` table its value's length is restricted to 255.

Furthermore some fields are too small to use the maximum supported value length.

To have a consistent size I capped the length of all string variable values to 255 and unified the corresponding SQL columns size accordingly.

 Enable multiple itemskill() calls per item

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

The current auto-cast code doesn't allow multiple `itemskill()` calls per item.
I changed the code to be vector based to be able to hold multiple auto-cast datasets.
Additionally the auto-cast cleaning related code was adjusted accordingly.
Other side effects are:
 * Using an item while the target cursor is active won't abort the skill anymore.
 * Auto-cast skills which are cast while casting another skill will now be executed when the current casting is finished.

 Fix conditions for calling pet_ai_sub_hard()
 ### Pull Request Prelude

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

The `pet_ai_hard` timer is executed before the pet's block and the pet master's block are added to the map, which causes nullpo errors in `pet_ai_sub_hard()`.
This wasn't noticed before #2600 was merged, because 0 was returned silently instead of using `nullpo_ret()`.
To fix this, the conditions for calling `pet_ai_sub_hard()` in `pet_ai_sub_foreachclient()` should be adjusted to check `sd->bl.prev` and `sd->pd->bl.prev` for `NULL`.

 * When a character unhides by using `@option 0`, clients are not being updated properly in `pc_setoption()` and thus causing crashes.
