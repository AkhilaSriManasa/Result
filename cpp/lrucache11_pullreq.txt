Fixes #5 

 Set prev link properly when adding to a 1-item list.
 When there is only 1 item in the list, a newly appended `n` node didn't have the `prev` property set correctly.  This leads to segfaults when calling `get` on the second item, because we later try to de-reference a `nullptr` that should be pointing to `head`.

 enable compilation on gcc 5.4 ubuntu
 
 Avoid nesting on Cache::prune by early returning
 
 Remove check for nullptr before deleting.
