 CI: Test building without C++ runtime on GCC/Clang.

 Backends: Vulkan: Rename internal helper ImGui_ImplVulkanH_CreateWindow to ImGui_ImplVulkanH_CreateOrResizeWindow
 Minor amend 9028088 (#3261)
 Backends: OSX: import the glfw workaround to avoid missing mouse clicks. (#3261)
 Examples: Apple: catch events from the right and other mouse buttons when using Cocoa. (#3260)
 Moved static array with non-trivial constructors outside of function seems to remove requirement of linking with libstdc++ on some compilers.
 IO: AddInputCharacters function ignore 0 input. (#3252)

Amend ef13d954 + c8ea0a01 (#2541, #2538, #2815)
 Backends: Allegro: Don't call AddInputCharacter if the pressed key has no character. (#3252)

 Fix typo/bug introduced by 0679e056 (#3231, #3209, #1829, #946, #413)

(docking branch already has it, so it'll probably conflict with same contents)
 Update README.md
 Fix GetGlyphRangesKorean() end-range to end at 0xD7A3 (instead of 0xD79D). (#348, #3217)

 Nav, Menus: Fix vertical wrap-around in menus or popups created with multiple appending calls to  BeginMenu()/EndMenu() or BeginPopup/EndPopup(). (#3223, #1207)

First call to EndPopup() called NavRequestTryWrapWindow() which performed wrap-around operation while we were not done composing menu. This resulted in navigation wrapping around to first item.
Since wrap-around operation is only valid in last call to EndPopup() and there is no way to know which call is last - this operation is delayed to the end of the frame.
 FocusWindow(NULL) correctly steal active id from previous window. (#1738) amend b0a9bbf6
 Backends: OpenGL: On OSX, if unspecified by app, made default GLSL version 150. (#3199)
 Internals: stand-in for large branches to facilitate merging.
 Internals: shuffling some sections (2)
 Internals: shuffling some sections, added index.
 Comments
 Fix to facilitate branch merges
