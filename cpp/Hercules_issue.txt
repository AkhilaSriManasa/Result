 **Describe the bug**
Unable to trade or create chatroom when dead

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Kill your self @die 
2. Try to Open chat room or perform trade to other player

**Expected behavior**
Players should be able to trade or create chatroom even dead.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**System specs (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: CentOS
 - Hercules Version: Latest
 - Mode: Pre-renewal (Did not test in renewal)
 - Packet version: 20151029
 - Client type: main

Its a bug i think, player complain they cant ask trade drasil leaf or bluegem  to other player to resu them.

Introduced in commit 6629dfd05f4ebef7862cd2d499b7330acc8d82ac

```c
static void clif_parse_TradeRequest(int fd, struct map_session_data *sd)
{
	struct map_session_data *t_sd;
	if (sd->state.trading || pc_isdead(sd) || pc_isvending(sd))
		return;
```
...

_PS. I know Technically it does makes sense - the dead can't trade - but then..._

 exp_group_db max number error
 Git revision (src): 'ec0584ac41434766e528b25730812da22ff31fc5'

**Describe the bug**
exp_group_db.conf set ThirdClasses MaxLevel to 185, but 182 exp is `2426009129`, map-server error is `mismatched element type in array`, then change 182 exp to `2147483647` is working.


for very big numbers need add ``L`` at end.
also if ``L`` added into one value in list, need add `L` value to all items in list.


add `L` at end, is working, thank @4144 

maybe exp_group_db.conf note add `for very big numbers need add L at end.`

 Possible underflow (?) in battle criticals
 **Describe the bug**
In battle.c:4654 critical is defined as
```c
		short cri = sstatus->cri;
```

A few lines later, the following problematic calculation is done:
```c
#ifndef RENEWAL
		//The official equation is *2, but that only applies when sd's do critical.
		//Therefore, we use the old value 3 on cases when an sd gets attacked by a mob
		cri -= tstatus->luk*(!sd&&tsd?3:2);
#else
		cri -= status->get_lv(target) / 15 + 2 * status_get_luk(target);
#endif
```

Both are using "luck" stat, which is an uint16. See status.h:1059, when `struct status_data` is declared:
```c
	uint16 str, agi, vit, int_, dex, luk;
```

This means that critical can underflow (?) here.
Because luck can go up to 65535, a monster could (in both modes) have at least 131070 crit def.
So the critical must accept at least `-131070` (an `int32` should do the trick)

**To Reproduce**
1. Set an arbitrary monster luck to 65535 (it will be accepted - no errors)
2. Fight with the monster.

**Expected behavior**
Modified monster should not receive crits, instead of always receiving crits.


**System specs (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux 4.15.0-45-generic #48-Ubuntu
 - Hercules Version: stable
 - Mode: both
 - Packet version: any
 - Client type: any

**Plugins used or source modifications**

 Remove misleading debug code for nonexistent skill unit group when ending SC_DANCING
 ### Pull Request Prelude

- [x] I have followed [proper Hercules code styling][code].
- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

In 00be89f `skill_stop_dancing()` was removed and its code moved to `status_change_end_()`.
When moving the code the `NULL` pointer check for the skill unit group was dropped which led to server crashes. ([Bug report.](https://herc.ws/oldboard/tracker/issue-3504-skill-delunitgroup-crashing-map-server-again/?gopid=3504#entry3504))
To track down the issue some debug code was added in 590cab6 and f41e10d.
Finally in 8aee60e the `NULL` pointer check was added back but the debug code wasn't removed which caused misleading debug messages until today.

To "fix" this, the ancient debug code should be removed.

 Fix left shift of negative value for GN_CRAZYWEED_ATK

### Changes Proposed

Pass `0` for `type` instead of `-1` when calling `skill_addtimerskill()` for `GN_CRAZYWEED`.
This value is later used to retrieve the skill's unit ID at the given index so `0` is the correct value for `GN_CRAZYWEED` since it has only one unit ID.

> also because was big changed in skill db,

Actually the changes are not that big. It just gives the impression because I outsourced many things into new functions and because I applied code style to existing functions.

> probably need add skill db dumper before this pr and after this pr (excluding db files changes). and compare output. output must be same

This won't work because some skills or parts of a skill won't be loaded due to the validations I added to the code and thus the dumps will never be identical.

 Hercules Ultimate Storage System

<!-- Thank you for working on improving Hercules! -->
<!-- Please complete these steps and check the following boxes by putting an `x`

- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

## Design

Implementation of the Hercules Ultimate Storage System
Storages can now be created through a configuration file that describes their attributes.
Example storage configuration:
    
```
{
        Id: (int)                              (required|unique) Unique Identifier
        Name: (string)                         (required) Name of the storage sent to the client.
        Capacity: (int)                        (required) Maximum capacity of the storage.
}
```

Additional storages are handled with dynamic arrays that will save a tonne of memory when created, as opposed to a design in which they were implemented using fixed length arrays. In simple terms, a storage of 600 items would approximately cost the same amount of memory as 600 storages with 1 item each.
They are saved in the same storage database (SQL) as the original separating them by a storage identifier.
An infinite number of storages can be created, there are no limits.
The current design implementation only allow saving/loading of approximately 1600 items per storage due to packet size limits.
    
PS. Make sure you apply SQL upgrades for this patch!

## Access Modes

Storage access modes can be set through the `openstorage` builtin command.

```
	STORAGE_ACCESS_VIEW     // View storage only
	STORAGE_ACCESS_GET      // Allow getting items from storage.
	STORAGE_ACCESS_PUT      // Allow putting items to storage.
	STORAGE_ACCESS_ALL      // Allow all actions.
```

Default storage mode : STORAGE_ACCESS_ALL

## Script Commands

Changed: `openstorage(<storage_id>{, <storage_mode>})`

Since it's kind of expectable to occasionally be unable to retrieve the target's `block_list` by its ID in `unit_steptimer()`, the `NULL` pointer report should be replaced with returning an error code.

 **CRITICAL BUG** Player consume ITMCHAIN_ORE when die in dungeon or fields.
 **Describe the bug**
Player consume ITMCHAIN_ORE when die in dungeon or fields.

**To Reproduce**
Go to dungeon or fields with any of ITMCHAIN_ORE's in your inventory. Type @die or get killed by mob and you lose 1 item.

I discovered that at /db/pre-re/item_chain.conf 
placing ITMCHAIN_SIEGFRIED on the top of the line will fix it.

**System specs (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Centos7 x64
 - Hercules Version LATEST
 - Mode: PRE-RE
 - Packet version: 20151029
 - Client type :MAIN


I tried this with 20 Coal in inventory as a level 1/1 Novice and could not reproduce the issue.
I tried dungeons and fields, using `@die` and being killed by monster, pre-RE and RE mode. Always the same result: No item lost.

@Kenpachi2k13  oh i forgot to include.
remove this group and try again sir.
```
ITMCHAIN_NEO_INSURANCE: {

<!-- You can safely ignore the links below:  -->

[cont]: https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[code]: https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/wiki/Coding-Style

If I see #718, it was discussed to send NUL at 24th char, but I see that you increased the name length to 25 characters.
There might be some side effects of this, as they won't receive null terminated strings (only 24 characters in packet), and they are known to be bad at this, (like some clients send nul terminated chats, some don't). Might need to check this with old clients as well.

I checked this and there are no side effects.
The name received in `clif_process_whisper_message()` is only used in `clif_parse_WisMessage()` and nowhere else.
Within `clif_parse_WisMessage()` are three different functions called with that name:

- `npc->name2id()`
- `channel->search()`
- `map->nick2sd()`

None of these function will run into problems since the name is `NULL` terminated in any case.
`safestrncpy(out_name, packet->name, NAME_LENGTH + 1);`

The name just might be too long (24 characters), but this is handled everywhere.

issue with name and without null termination can be if send packet from server to client, but here look like all only inside server

 Map-Server Crashing with GDB debug
 **Describe the bug**
- This map-server would crash randomly throughout the day and this was the debug of the first crash - https://pastebin.com/g8az1tTv  and afterwhich 4144 in the Discord suggested to try to update to this Pull Request (https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/pull/2713) which I did and make clean and re-compiled.

After few hours the map server is crashing again with the debug code - http://www.pastebin.com/AZXpWkZF

Appreciate if anyone could provide a permanent fix to this crash.


**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**System specs (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. windows 10 version 1809, macOS 10.14] - Debian 10

**Plugins used or source modifications**
If you are using any plugins besides the ones that come bundled with Hercules,
please enumerate them here.

- No modifications on the source nor plugins were use

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here. If the bug report is about a
crash, please attach the core/stack-dump or crash-log, if any.

any pattern to this crash? or you can't find info on it yet?

Previously I had an issue where a malformed reg value caused map server crashes whenever a player with one of the malformed values logged out. This was caused by set(getvariableofpc()), but that bug was fixes years ago AFAIK.

i think issue isolated. Soon in given pr should be fix.


now it should be fixed in pr #2713


I can confirmed this is fixed as I no longer experiencing crashing as of now.

using gepard?


or any other server modifications or plugins?

@4144  yes gepard


i can suspect gepard issue, because similar issue was at least on two servers with gepard.

crash also may happened unrelated to reported stack. try run map server with ``gdb`` and at next crash show output from gdb command ``bt``


can you show parts of code from each file reported in this stack?

Yes i will post. And also i enable gdb to get better error report incase it crash again

`char_id
Did you intentionally enable character IDs lower than 150000?

@Kenpachi2k13 not intentional , it happened when i empty the char table and player created started to 1. i did not rollback and leave as is but change starting char# at mmo.

~~I had a look at this and I don't think this is an issue related to Hercules.~~
~~In all 3 debug messages you posted the value of `val1` is `655681`. `val1` holds a skill ID and there is no such skill ID in Hercules.~~
~~Furthermore `val3` looks weird, too. It holds a skill level and in all 3 debug messages it's much greater than 100...~~

~~In my opinion this issue is caused by modifications.~~

Okay, nevermind.
I did some more searching and this issue exists since 2009.
Only pre-RE server seem to be affected.
It is expected to be related to crossing songs/dances.

 Quest_Moscovia - Loop
 Moscovia quests seems to go into a loop. Once you go to the Whale island the old man acts like if it was your first time and takes you back to moscovia.

1. You get to the boat, kill the monsters, do the coordinates.
2. You get to the island, you talk to the old man, the old man takes you to moscovia.
3. You talk to the sailor again. Sailor tells you to go to talk to the King.
4. King tells you to go back to the Island.
5. You get into the boat again, kill the monsters, do the coordinates.
6. Talk to the old man. The old man should ask you for materials to build the Gunsli. But instead he takes you back to moscovia.

 Fix condition for deleting skill units when unloading NPC
 ### Pull Request Prelude

- [x] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines][cont] before making this PR.
- [x] I am aware that this PR may be closed if the above-mentioned criteria are not fulfilled.

### Changes Proposed

Currently it's almost impossible to fulfil the condition for calling `skill_clear_unitgroup()` in `npc_unload()` since `nd->ud` always is `NULL` or `&npc->base_ud` if `unit_bl2ud2()` was never called for the NPC's block_list (for example by `npcspeed()`).
I changed the condition to only check for `nd->ud != NULL` to ensure that all skill units belonging to the unloaded NPC are deleted.

 Break Weapon not affecting Subtype Mace
 **Describe the bug**
Tested with bBreakWeaponRate only. all weapon that has W_MACE subtype is not affected or does not get broken... tested on a clean copy of hercules

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. use a item with 100% bBreakWeaponRate 
2. player b will equip a mace type weapon
3. it won't break 
4. No error or any kind of message... But other weapons such as dagger still break.

**Expected behavior**
W_MACE type should also be affected by bBreakWeaponRate  or break status

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**System specs (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [Ubuntu 19]
 - Hercules Version [v2020.05.03] (fresh copy upon submitting this)
 - Mode: [pre-renewal]
 - Packet version: [2016-02-03]
 - Client type: [RE]

**Plugins used or source modifications**
NO PLUGIN USED

**Additional context**
Seems that even melt down can't break mace type.

Mace and axe weapons are unbreakable
