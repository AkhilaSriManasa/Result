 Updated MQTTSNGateway README
 Updated MQTTSNGateway README as per current working of gateway.
 Update MQTTSNPacket.c
 Looks like a bug in MQTTSNPacket_len(). If the input parameter is 255, it will return 256, but the actual packet size will be 258.

 Fix bug for messages of length 0x100
 If the parameter `length` is 255 bytes the result of the previous `MQTTSNPacket_len` implementation was 256 bytes. But such a message actually needs a 3-octet long Length field, so it should return 258 instead.

 BugFix of #171 and PINGREQ and PINGRESP error of Adapter class
 
 Support for MacOS
 Got it to compile on MacOS. I had to split semaphore into Semaphore and NamedSemaphore classes like in boost. Semaphore is implemented with Grand Central Dispatch because sem_init returns not implemented error MacOS. NamedSemaphore uses the spin lock approach like in boost for sem_timedwait. sem_getvalue is also not supported on MacOS so I had to remove it, this is the only possible source of problems in this patch.

Note the change in MQTTSNSearchClient.c, there seems to be a bug: (gatewayaddress_len > 0) is always true, I assume it must be (*gatewayaddress_len > 0)
 Fix documentation of MQTTSNPacket_decode
 Added a documentation for the missing parameters buf and buflen and
removed the non-existing parameter getcharfn.

 BugFix of #149 and #151
 update README
 Improve documentation
 This PR should improve the README of the MQTTSNGateway. I missed information about support of IPv6. I found nothing on my first try, but then I had a look at Issues and PRs and I found an old PR #60, which adds support for it. Stuff like that should be mentioned somewhere in my opinion, so that people can easliy find out if support is available.
 Add functions of Aggregating Gateway, QoS-1 and forwarder encapsulation.
 
 Message loss for subscribed topics after gateway restart #134
 
 Install the gateway into any directories. #124
 
 You can select Aggregate or Transparent gateway in the config file setting.
 Forwarder encapsulation is available.
QoS-1 PUBLISH is available.


 Pre-defined-topic and Forwarder Encapsulation are supported.
 Set parameters in the gateway.conf and related files as follows:     
When **PredefinedTopic** is **YES**, Pre-definedTopicID file specified by **PredefinedTopicList** is effective.     
This file defines Pre-definedTopics of the clients. In this file, ClientID,TopicName and TopicID are declared in CSV format.        
When **Forwarder** is YES, Forwarder Encapsulation Message is available. Connectable Forwarders are specifed by **ForwardersList** file. In this file, ForwarderIds and those sensorNet addresses are declared in CSV format.    
 install the gateway system-wide
 I wanted to be able to build and run this from a system-wide environment without needing to know the location of the git clone. 
So I updated the Makefile to take a prefix and install the components there...
 Add Pre-defined-topic
 Pre-defined-topic is available.   
 Add two test programs.
 Add two programs to test the non-clean session.
one is MQTT-SNPub and the other is MQTT-SNSub. 
 Update:  It's safer to use s6_addr32 macro than implementation specific union details.
 
 Improve UDPv6 code portability
 Hi,
It's safer to use `s6_addr32` macro than implementation specific union details.
