 Fixed TangoInitializationHelper.java for API 24+
 Fixed the new [Log tag 23 character limit](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html#isLoggable%28java.lang.String,%20int%29)  imposed if using API 24+ since `TangoInitializationHelper` is 25 characters

 and also removed x86 options since they were removed in #102 from the `Application.mk` files

 Build example projects for all available architectures
 Currently, example projects will only build for armeabi-v7a. This change makes it so that all projects will build for x86, arm64, and arm by default. I've tested this locally and all projects built without issue.
