Thank you for your report.

However, debugging the problem requires additional information.

Thank you for the suggestion.

I think this project is unstable for current use.
I will test it when I have time.

Thank you anyway.

 Error In Open GuidMap
 Friend,

I got error when running these code, May I know Why?Couldn't open guidmap

if (!BE1::resourceGuidMapper.Read("Data\\guidmap")) {
        BE_FATALERROR("Couldn't open guidmap !");
    }
It means that you ran BlueshiftPlayer.exe in the wrong location.

Running BlueshiftPlayer.exe from the source code is not currently recommended. I will add the document later.

Thanks.

 [Engine] UI system
 We need GUI system
Implemented in v0.7

 Add a Codacy badge to README.md
 None
 could you open editor sources?
 when i use cmake 
CMake Warning at Source/ThirdParty/ToolWindowManager/CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):

Building editor from source code are not available for now.

To build the engine from source code, you can follow the instructions below.

https://github.com/PolygonTek/BlueshiftEngine/wiki/How-to-Build-Engine-Runtime-Libraries

We don't have any plan to release full source code including editor yet.

 [Editor] Keep Crashing on start-up
 i do not know if it was crash or just stuck. but everytimes i start the editor the "windows problem reporting" always appeared in the task manager, and the editor windows is never appeared. what possibly i have missed?
Please let me know the execution environment first. Graphics card, OS version, etc.

And did you run the 0.4 version? Or did you compile the engine yourself?

If you run the editor for the first time, a dialog box will pop up to find the project directory. If it crashes before the dialog, run regedit.exe and delete `HKEY_CURRENT_USER / Software / PolygonTek`. And re-run it.

it was : 
- Windows 10 home 64bit
- the graphic card : AMD Radeon HD 7400G
- the processor : AMD A4-4335 APU

i already set the project directory, exactly it crash after that, i have tried to re-run the editor but it still the same, i used the latest release of the editor and not yet compile the engine myself 

Was the project directory you were trying to open `BasicGame` ? 

If so, can you see the `BasicGame/Log/log.txt` ?

the editor is did not want to running, how could i create or even open any project?

Did you download example project ? [Example Projects](https://github.com/PolygonTek/BlueshiftExamples/archive/master.zip)

Not supported creating new project in editor yet. (will be fixed)

If the editor does not appear on the screen, delete the registry key again.

not yet, hold on sec

its works now, i'm sorry i did not know if the sample is required to run the editor, thanks for the assist

anyway, where is the lua scripting reference i can read?

I'm planning to make scripting API documentation. You can see the issue #19.
Until then you can reference the source code (cpp) to use.
https://github.com/PolygonTek/BlueshiftEngine/tree/master/Source/BlueshiftEngine/Private/Script
Or see the sample script. 

I know that it is inconvenient to use. But please understand that it is an alpha stage engine.
It will be improved later.

it's okay, i'm okay with learning from example, i'm surely understand, i keep support your development, i looking forward for future features implementation

Thank you for your support. 😃

 Editor source?
 Hi,
Excellent job on your engine progress, I'm working on Urho3D based fork engine and would like to add editor support in the future, any plan to release the editor code?
Thanks for the your interest of our works.
I'm sorry but we don't have any plan to release editor source code yet.



Thanks for answer.

 [Engine] Lua scripting
 I think we need to support below features in the future release.
Some of them are already implemented in the development branch.

- [x] Support Lua 5.1 to support LuaJIT
- [x] Support LuaJIT x86_64 (Windows, macOS)
- [x] Support LuaJIT ARM (LuaJIT ARM64 is in beta for now)
- [x] Debugging functionality (using [ZeroBrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/))

 [Engine] Noise module in particle system
 It will be awesome to add noise module in particle system.

 [Engine] Automatic script binding
 We need more general solution for script binding. 
I think manually bound Lua code is not sustainable in development progress.

I'm considering to use SWIG for now.
 [Engine] Need support DDS in BC6/BC7 format
 
 Editor Soon?
 Hey I have just come across this engine, and it looks great! I was wondering when the editor source would be available or a new build released to see all of the new features and test it out to see if it would be a good match for making a game instead of unity or unreal.
Thank you for your interest. we don't have any plan yet for the editor source release but new binary build (v0.2) will be released as soon as possible.

 [Engine] Add skybox
 - [x] Add cubemap skybox shader
- [x] Add 6 sided skybox shader
 [Engine] Physically based lighting
 - [x] Implement PBR lighting shaders
- [x] Add environment probe to pre-compute diffuse/specular lighting
- [x] Blending environment proves
 [Engine] Image resize in linear color space
 
 [Engine] No IK Function and Physic Cloth yet
 this engine is close to perfect, i looking forward for this feature enabled in blueshift engine
 [Editor] Dockable widget is not working as intended especially in macOS
 windows 버젼에서는 문제가 없는데, macOS 버젼에서는 dock 의 split 되고 합치는 과정이 매끄럽지가 않습니다. Qt 의 버그처럼 보입니다.
Unity 나 Stingray 에디터에서 처럼 동작하는 custom dock widget 을 구현하는게 좋을 것 같습니다. 기본 Qt widget 으로는 구현이 불가능하기 때문에 구현하려면 Qt 내부의 소스분석이 필요해 보입니다.

We need tabbed dock widget like Unity or Unreal.

Implemented in v0.3.0

 [Editor] Can edit multiple selected entities
 New property system is required to support this feature.
Implemented in v0.3.0

 [Engine] Engine 을 DLL 형태의 동적 링크 라이브러리로 제공 
 현재 엔진을 빌드하면 static library 로 떨어집니다. 에디터의 소스가 공개되고 있지 않으므로 엔진을 DLL 형태로 만들어야 수정버젼을 에디터에서 시험해 볼 수 있는 방식이 됩니다. (물론 에디터 소스가 공개되면 이런 과정은 필요없을지도 모릅니다) 

참고로 iOS 8 부터 Apple 에서도 Framework 형태로 동적 링킹을 지원한다고 합니다.

 CONTRIBUTING.md 문서 만들기

 [Editor] FBX 파일 임포트시 embeded texture 도 한꺼번에 import 하도록 수정 필요
 FBX 파일에 texure 도 함께 embed 하는 기능이 있습니다. FBX SDK 의 import 함수를 호출 하는 순간 FBX 파일이 있는 디렉토리에 파일이 풀립니다. 현재는 이렇게 풀린 파일이 에디터에서 임포트 과정을 거치지 않습니다. 임시방편으로 에디터를 껐다가 켜면 embeded 파일이 임포트 됩니다.
Fixed in v0.5.0

 [Editor] macOS 에디터 화면 버그
 macOS 에디터 상에서 Qt warning message 가 계속 발생합니다.

Scene dock 과 Game dock 전환시에 화면이 까맣게 나오는 현상이 있습니다.
정확한 원인은 파악이 안되고 있으나 Qt 와 OpenGL 의 충돌인 것 같습니다.
제 컴퓨터에 깔린 Qt 5.6.2 와 engine 의 OpenGL context 가 충돌을 일으키는 것으로 짐작됩니다.
Qt 5.6.0 으로 link 하면 해결됩니다.
