 [FIX] Update base mana regen
 The calculations for base mana regen were wrong.

While the MP5 rule was removed from the game (only updating players mana every 5 seconds) in cataclysm, the base mana regen is still calculated with the 5 second increment.

Tested ingame and compared to stable cores like PandaWoW & Tauri.
this reverts my commit from august 2019
https://github.com/ProjectSkyfire/SkyFire_548/commit/42b50617f55472841b4ec7e4f1e5c64609860c77


Priest Combat Regen 300K * 0.02 = 6000

Before Mists of Pandaria 0.004 would be correct.
300K * 0.004 = 1200

so i guess tauri or punda didnt updated the formula.

 Compile error on win10 x64 visual2019
 Huge wall of useless text.
https://pastebin.com/CVisLJUe
The compiler is broken after VS2019 update. Microsoft has to fix it. It's not a skyfire bug.

ok thanks, any other way to compile it ?

i believe you should update ACE to newer version

temporary solved like this, download visual studio 2017 , download ACE from here http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/previous_versions/ACE+TAO-6.5.3.zip , compile it in VS2017, find ACE.lib you compiled and put it in skyfire ace folder then go to build skyfire in VS2019 and remove ACE from projects

@kicho  Can you send me your ace.lib? 👯 

This is a known issue. Download the preview version of visual studio. Don't do the hack Kicho suggested. Microsoft issue not SkyFire's. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/

Thanks, i got it.

See https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO/pull/1114 for a fix which will be part of the next ACE release

What your problem ?

Texts should be read from database rather than written into script.
This should be done to reduce size of core and improve performance, no problems.
Do you close it without testing it? it is interesting.

Merge this. i want commit new fix in this file.

 Black Market Auction House (BMAH) NPC <Madam Goya> is not working
 <!--- (**********************************)
      (** Fill in the following fields **)
      (**********************************) --->

**Description:**

Black Market Auction House (BMAH) NPC <Madam Goya> is not working. 

**Current behaviour:**

When you click on NPC nothing happens (No reaction). **Is not opening.** 

**Expected behaviour:**

It should open the Black Market Auction House...

**Steps to reproduce the problem:**

1. Teleport to Pandaria using .tele pandaria 
2. Travel to "Tavern in the Mists" location and there are two houses with Black Market Auction Houses one of them is Madam Goya NPC and the other I think is broken too. (Both BMAH NPCs are not working).

wrong coalition
utf8 is an alias for utf8mb3.
utf8mb = contains 1 byte
utf8mb2 = contains 2 bytes
utf8mb3 = contains 3 bytes
utf8mb4 = contains 4 bytes
https://wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8
make sure you use utf8mb4 as your char set like the database is and don't use custom char sets.
https://www.eversql.com/mysql-utf8-vs-utf8mb4-whats-the-difference-between-utf8-and-utf8mb4/

In other words you try to put 2 bytes from the errors above into an 1 byte char set.
