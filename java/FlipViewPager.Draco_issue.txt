 Update README.md
 
 Horizontal list
 Hello...

I'm working on a news app and I'd like to view my articles in a horizontal fashion i.e once a user opens an article at position say i, I'd like to be able to flip/swipe between the articles....
Unlike your sample project (where we have a horizontal and vertical scroll), I will not be merging any views... I just want the horizontal flip between my items....

How can I accomplish this with this library ?
 onClickListener
 my issue is when I click on image then it filliping same as when I swap left or right 
please give the solution what i do as soon


Hi, @rgjatin! I suppose, You should override `onItemClickMethod()` so that it shouldn't flip pages

 OnItemClick does not work properly 
 Sometimes it works and shows the toast and sometime it doesn't respond

Hi, @arhamranjha! Can you please provide more information about what you are doing? Are you using `ListView` or `RecyclerView`?

 listview set a wrong adaptor
 Java code(FriendsActivity):
friends.setAdapter(new FriendsAdapter(this, Utils.friends, settings));

Here are the errors:
Error:(36, 16) error: no suitable method found for setAdapter(FriendsActivity.FriendsAdapter)
method AdapterView.setAdapter(ListAdapter) is not applicable
(argument mismatch; FriendsActivity.FriendsAdapter cannot be converted to ListAdapter)
method AbsListView.setAdapter(ListAdapter) is not applicable
(argument mismatch; FriendsActivity.FriendsAdapter cannot be converted to ListAdapter)
method ListView.setAdapter(ListAdapter) is not applicable
(argument mismatch; FriendsActivity.FriendsAdapter cannot be converted to ListAdapter)

Hi, @luoguibin , can you provide some more code. Specifically i want to look at your FriendsAdapter


Having the same issue. I just wanted to try the sample before implementing it in my own project. It's giving me the above mentioned error by @luoguibin 

Hi, @andy1729! Are you using `ListView` or `RecyclerView`?

Hello, @warko-san sorry for late reply, I am using ListView. Should I use RecyclerView?

I am also facing the same problem. List view adapter showing error

is there anyway to use recyclerAdapter?

Say goodbye to Android, say hello to H5~

 friends(Listview) can't be set adapter with FriendsAdapter
 I want to start sample java file But It can't be start Because It can't be set adapter with FriendsAdapter... why can't I do that?

Hello, @myeongsic89  , can you please provide some code ?


sorry I'm late I found the solution https://github.com/Yalantis/FlipViewPager.Draco/issues/17


 about item click
 It's not proper about code if(ev.getRowX() 
I change the code like below:
  if (Math.abs(ev.getX() - mLastMotionX) < mTouchSlop ||
                            Math.abs(ev.getY() - mLastMotionY) < mTouchSlop) 
and it works fine.

Thank you very much , man ! It works perfect!


Hi, @weity! Thank you for your solution. You can suggest pull request to fix this issue. We appreciate it.

hey... I have fixed man... do like this...
1. go to here...
public FriendsAdapter(Context context, List<Friend> items, FlipSettings settings, CloseListener closeListener) {...}
and remove the "CloseListener closeListener" paframeter.
2. go to build.gradle(Module: app)...
then you should declare this one..
compile 'com.yalantis:flipviewpager:1.0.0' instead of  compile project(':flipviewpager')
that's all...

 Flip view programmatically
 I was wondering if it is possible to flip the view programmatically since I want the view to flip when the user taps on it. Thanks in advance.

Same here.


same for me!


There 's no such functional for now, we will consider it for the future versions


 Sample with errors
 Hi, I'm trying to implement this beautiful library in my project, what is happening is I cannot set an adapter that extends BaseFlipAdapter in a ListView. In the sample the ListView friends sets a BaseFlipAdapter and for some reason it can't, help please.

Same issue for me.
What should I do to fix this problem ?


@ahmediego Still looking for it, have you fixed it?

@cleanOK Any thoughts?


@joaosardinha Same for me, still looking for it.


may be it doesn't work with api 23, if anyone found some solution , kindly post it in here


@johnrao7 I doubt that's that problem

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15181917/14150695/32d17baa-f6a2-11e5-8030-a9c6f7660510.png)


@joaosardinha maybe it stopped working since then


dev branch has working sample


@akrupych-remit can you link it here?


Sure I can: https://github.com/Yalantis/FlipViewPager.Draco/tree/develop


@johnrao7 @ahmediego I just updated Android Studio to v2 and the sample is working


 Buttons in the info page are receiving clicks on main listview
 
Hello, please provide more info about issue


outdated


 Feature/setting height to static
 
 Made views inside the FlipViewPager clickable and updated to API 23
 
Please merge this.


 Right Image can flip 10 times
 Hi! I copied all the code from the sample and the images on the right side can flip 10 times, why is it happening? shouldn't it flip just one time?
Also, when here is an odd number of items, the very last space (which holds no item, cause it's an odd number) can be flipped
Thanks!

Hello,sorry but we can't reproduce this


Outdated


 click item will be crashed , when make listview  add footer view
 E/MessageQueue-JNI: Exception in MessageQueue callback: handleReceiveCallback
E/MessageQueue-JNI: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 9, size is 1
                                                                                   at java.util.ArrayList.throwIndexOutOfBoundsException(ArrayList.java:255)

Hello, i found the problem. 
 friends.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int position, long id) {
                   if(position<friends.getAdapter().getCount()){
                Friend f = (Friend) friends.getAdapter().getItem(position);
                Toast.makeText(FriendsActivity.this, f.getNickname(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
            }
        });

because by adding the footer you add more item to the listView , but not to the list itself,so you will need the protecting if.


 Row Height on Tablet
 Hello,

Thank you for the library, I am using it in a project but when I test it on a tablet, the row height is too narrow. And the images appears with a very wrong aspect ratio. I tried changing the scale type but nothing worked. The problem seems in the listView row height. ( The problem also is present in the demo provided with your pictures)

Do you have any idea how to change the row height? 

Thank you
Elie

Hello, thanks for your feedback,we're working to fix that. When repository updates there will be method setItemHeight in BaseFlipAdapter, so you can call it in getPage like this setItemHeight(getResources().getDimension(R.dimen.item_height));. 
Alse you will need to override dimension for different screeens ,and set this height for image views in your merge_page.xml .Like this 
    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/first"
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_weight="1"
        android:contentDescription="left image"
        android:layout_height="@dimen/item_height"
        android:scaleType="fitXY" />

```
<LinearLayout
    android:layout_width="1dp"
    android:layout_weight="0"
    android:background="#000000"
    android:layout_height="@dimen/item_height"/>

<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/second"
    android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:contentDescription="right image"
    android:layout_height="@dimen/item_height"
    android:scaleType="fitXY" />
```

for example this dimens worked for me 

default dimens.xml

<dimen name="item_height">200dp</dimen>

dimens.xml (xlarge)

 <dimen name="item_height">400dp</dimen>


Thank you for the fix


 When getDegreesDone() > Hello,
When getDegreesDone() >= 90 then other half goes to white. For example when I flip right to left, the right side goes to white when getDegreesDone() >= 90. What can I do to solve this problem?
Thank you

 Replacing the deprecated <ActionBarActivity> with <AppCompatActivity>
 Replacing the deprecated <ActionBarActivity> with <AppCompatActivity>

already done


 Is it possible to programmatically open a detailled view ?
 I think everything is on the subject :-)

It's in the case a user click on a picture, so the detailed view is opened.

I think it's not natural to swipe the view if you don't know already what is behind.

This is possible. But you should add code your project and you can customize the code. For example I put a close button in detail view. And when I clicked the close button, the view return to first page.


Hi ,
Can you explain the way or give code snippet to achieve this.Thanks in advance


Closing is possible via FlipViewPager.flipToPage(DEFAULT_PAGE)


 setOnClickListener inside flipviewpager not working
 I am trying to implement this in one of my project but the views coming after flip are no taking OnClickListener event.
For example textviews after flip the image not taking clicklisener event
Please help to sort out this.

Hey Omi,
I am facing the same issue. I am adding custom text view when the page is flipped but I am not able to input/select anything in the textview. Also, I added a button but it's not clickable.
Where you able to find any solution to this?
Thanks


Anyone solve this please?


@shivdoshi @OmiAndroid @Aabidi09 
Yah I did this, follow this procedure...
1) Comment all OnInterceptTouchEvent in FlipViewpager.java

2) Replace following methods with code given here 
          private boolean flipped=false;
          public void flipToPage(int page) {
                     int delta = page \* FLIP_DISTANCE - (int) mFlipDistance;
                     endFlip();
                     mScroller.startScroll(0, (int) mFlipDistance, 0, delta, getFlipDuration(delta));
                     invalidate();
                     flipped=!flipped;
            }

```
       @Override
        public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
              if(flipped){
              return false;
              }else{
               return true;
        }
       }
```

3) Register OnClickListeners on views in fillHolder() of your adapter (adapter that extends BaseFlipAdapter)


@KishorAndroid  your solution denies the user to possibility to close the filpview once opened


I think I found a solution:

Modify `FlipViewPager.onInterceptTouchEvent()` as following:

```
@Override
public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
        View view = mCurrent.pageView;
        if (view instanceof ViewGroup) {
            ViewGroup viewGroup = (ViewGroup) view;
            for (int i = 0; i < viewGroup.getChildCount(); i++) {
                View childView = viewGroup.getChildAt(i);
                if (childView.isClickable() && isPointInsideView(ev.getRawX(), ev.getRawY(), childView)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
       // rest of the method as it is
}
```

with

```
private boolean isPointInsideView(float x, float y, View view) {
        int location[] = new int[2];
        view.getLocationOnScreen(location);
        int viewX = location[0];
        int viewY = location[1];

        //point is inside view bounds
        return (x > viewX && x < (viewX + view.getWidth())) &&
                (y > viewY && y < (viewY + view.getHeight()));
    }
```

This will simply check if there was a e.g. a button clicked and will return `false` therefore, so the button gets the event.


Try this... working well for me

`@Override
    public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
        if(flipped){
            return false;
        }else{
            return true;
        }
    }`

`private boolean flipped=false;
    public void flipToPage(int page) {
        int delta = page * FLIP_DISTANCE - (int) mFlipDistance;
        endFlip();
        mScroller.startScroll(0, (int) mFlipDistance, 0, delta, getFlipDuration(delta));
        invalidate();
        Log.d("FlipDistance", "delta " + delta + " mFlipDistance " + mFlipDistance);
        if(delta <=0 && delta >-90){
            flipped=false;
            Log.d("FlipDistance", "Flipped Cancel");
            return;
        }
        if(delta >=0 && delta < 90){
            flipped=false;
            Log.d("FlipDistance", "Flipped Cancel");
            return;
        }
        flipped=!flipped;
    }`


@KishorAndroid 
It works sometime even when the view is not flipped . I mean the buttons on the flipped view are responding even when not in view.


I managed to solve this with the code given in this link. (The answer is in the comments).
http://android-delight.blogspot.in/2015/04/flipviewpager-in-list-view.html

But as mentioned above, buttons can be clicked even if the view is not flipped. This means that user is able to click unseen buttons. Is there a way to eliminate this problem. Thanks in advance.


@KishorAndroid  I followed your steps but Its not working for me. Please help!


@digitex5 I followed the post but it still didnt work. Am i missing something?


 OnItemClick works only with two fingers or repeated clicks
 There will be a fix for this problem? thank you

What is the OS version are you using? 
Can't reproduce for now :-(


Android 5.02 , thanks for replying 


Cannot reproduce


I am having the same issue any solution to it ? 


 used inside viewpager
 i want to use FlipViewPager inside viewpager, it is not worked.. because when i flip it considered its parent view.. in my side, i am using as parent view, viewpager... so how to implement it inside viewpager...

Same issue here.
As a workaround, I used this:
