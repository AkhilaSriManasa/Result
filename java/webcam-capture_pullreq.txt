 Remove redundant initialization
 Remove redundant initialization. We don't need to initialize t1 and t2 to a value since below k and p are explicitly defined in for loop and there's no other implicit conditions that may cause an runtime error if t1 and t2 are not initialized
 Address MacOS Catalina no webcam found issue 
 This PR attempts to address the issue in #723 

The updated .dylib is from 1.4-SNAPSHOT of OpenIMAJ.  The author has addressed in the issues in Catalina where it is necessary to ask the user's permission to access the camera.  The OpenIMAJGrabber is updated to reflect changes in the native interface.

I have tested this now on Catalina and it does detect all connected webcams.  However there is a problem trying to open the session from java, this error occurs:

This app has crashed because it has a hardened runtime and attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without an entitlement indicating its intent to access this data.  The app must have the 'com.apple.security.device.camera' entitlement.

I suspect if you package your java program into an .app with the correct entitlements it will work.  I haven't tried this because OpenJDK 14 has some trouble with jpackage right now.

This is a security fix for a  vulnerability in your [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) `pom.xml` file(s).

The build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
This leaves your build vulnerable to allowing a [Man in the Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) (MITM) attackers to execute arbitrary code on your or your computer or CI/CD system.

This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of [8.1/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

[POC code](https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/) has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file in-flight.
MITM attacks against HTTP are [increasingly common](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050), for example [Comcast is known to have done it to their own users](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/#).

This contribution is a part of a submission to the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) Bug Bounty program.

## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities

 Exclude unused transitive dependency
 Hello, I noticed that the transitive dependency `com.google.android.tools:dx` can be safely excluded from direct dependency `com.nativelibs4java:bridj`  in module `webcam-capture-driver-openimaj`. This makes the dependency tree of the module slimmer.

 Run code inspection
 Sorry for this huge PR.

I was warned by my IDE for a non atomic operation.
So I decide to check where it was from and I found that `volatile double fps` was sometime got and set at the same time. So I replaced it by an AtomicDouble...

And then I decided to run a code inspection.

I corrected some of the warnings.
Each warning type is splitting on a different commit so it will be easier to review.
 Support Java11
 1) Added `<artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>` to webcam-capture-driver-ipcam dependencies (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52502189/java-11-package-javax-xml-bind-does-not-exist)

2) Added `<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>` to webcam-capture-parent plugins since `<groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId> <artifactId>maven-bundle-plugin</artifactId>` was packed with an unsupported version for Java 11. `mvn test` now works almost smoothly (see 3th steps)...

3) Upgraded all unit test dependencies: some of them were crashing on Java 11. Upgrade them resolve the problem. I did not investigate more. (thanks to `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates`)
 dependencies: update VlcJ from 2.4.1 to 3.12.1
 
 dependencies: update JavaCV from 1.3.3 to 1.5.1
 
 Dependencies update vlcj
 I did not update VlcJ to 4.2.0 since the API has some breaking change and I do not know how to use this library.
 Dependencies update javacv
 
 cleanup resource folder and enhance unit test coverage to 40.5%
 @sarxos , please review changes. I created new request for cleanup resource folder.
thanks,
Alex

 Add new FFmpeg driver
 Hello @sarxos,

I rewrote the FFmpeg driver from scratch (using bgr24 as you suggested). It seems stable even with high frame rates.

My only concern is that getImageBytes methods are dealing with BGR instead of RGB (is that a problem?).

You can find a working example at [my repository](https://github.com/yuripourre/webcam-capture-ffmpegcliv2/blob/webcam-capture-driver/src/main/java/ffmpegcli/BGRExample.java).

Please feel free to suggest any modification.
