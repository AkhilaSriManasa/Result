Updates `jackson-databind` from 2.9.9 to 2.10.0.pr1 **This update includes a security fix.**
<details>
<summary>Vulnerabilities fixed</summary>

*Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.*

> **Low severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind**
> FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.1 might allow attackers to have a variety of impacts by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class from polymorphic deserialization. Depending on the classpath content, remote code execution may be possible.

 Squash Integration
 This is a patch to integrate Squash.io with Lavagna. I believe this is going to be handy to the project so any project maintainers and developers can quickly check the branch changes deployed on its own isolated VM.

Example of Lavagna working with Squash (credentials: user/user): https://squash-setup-cagmw.squash.io

Squash is free for Open Source, maintainers just need to [signup](https://squash.io/signup/) and reach out to the support through the chat window and we will enable a forever free Open Source account. Once this is done, Squash will post a comment on each Pull Request like this:

![squash-pr-comment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98694/50752537-de98b200-120b-11e9-9d8f-264eddc4ca3f.png)

When you click on the Squash link in a new PR it will deploy the branch of code into a brand new VM, **this process takes about 2 minutes**.  

Let me know what you think please. Thanks.

 Fix java.lang.IllegalArgumentException when setting the Remember Me cookie under Tomcat
 The current code in UserSession.java is using a comma (",") to separate the user id from the user token in the remember-me cookie: unfortunately the comma is not a valid character for a cookie value according to RFC 6265 and Tomcat rejects it with a 500 error and the following exception:

This pull requests simply replaces the comma with a slash, which hopefully won't ever be found in a user id or user token.
 Calendar feed: use UTC in card and milestone due date
 This PR intends to fix an issue close to #70: when loading the calendar feed into a calendar application, due dates have no timezone indication and thus may appear earlier or later than the actual date .

For example, when I set a due date for 2017-04-03, my server which is in the Europe/Paris timezone outputs a calendar entry such as:

````
BEGIN:VEVENT
DTSTAMP:20170402T154957Z
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE;VALUE=DATE:20170402

where the actual due date appears in the JSON responses from Lavagna as:

````
            "labelColor": 0,
            "labelDomain": "SYSTEM",
            "labelId": 6,
            "labelName": "DUE_DATE",
            "labelProjectId": 2,
            "labelType": "TIMESTAMP",
            "labelUnique": true,
            "labelValueCard": null,

            "labelValueList": null,
            "labelValueString": null,
            "labelValueTimestamp": "2017-04-02T22:00:00.000Z",
            "labelValueType": "TIMESTAMP",
            "labelValueUseUniqueIndex": true,

            "value": {

                "valueInt": null,
                "valueList": null,
                "valueString": null,
                "valueTimestamp": "2017-04-02T22:00:00.000Z",
                "valueUser": null
            }
````

The 2-hours difference with GMT and the loss of the time component make calendar applications believe that this due date is Apr, 2 2017 at midnight, which is a day earlier than intended.

Due dates for milestones have the same issue.

With the changes from this pull request, due dates for cards and milestones are exported in UTC time so that calendar applications can correctly display dates and reminders.

Due to compression, the difference is hard to spot, but a closer look reveals the improvement :)
