 Static bug #12 fix for Kafka_Streams_TensorFlow_Image_Recognition_Example.java

H2O module was already fixed with PR #13 

Those IntegrationTest contains still these prolems, but in real life test should not contain implementation anyway.
 TopologyTestDriver based unit tests
 This is PR related to Issue #11

It contains also some Readme updates and renaming of one directory due to typo.
 Splitting Different Examples to independent modules
 This is rather radical refactoring of the project, but I hope this split would make it easier to understand relationship and dependencies of each example.

What do you think about this kind of split?

Folder (modules) split now based on Example sections in Readme. 
I expect also that StreamsStarterApp.java could be removed and that way whole src folder.

You might have better idea how to split or name these modules and how to restructure Readme, but here is my proposal.

Sorry, this version still contains those Windows unit test workarounds:

I can also remove those if wanted.
