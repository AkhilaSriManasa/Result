 Raspberrypi drivers using raspixxx CLI, refs #694
 @alexmao86 Can we change this to:

```plain
*.jar
*.zip
```

 @alexmao86 Are these java classes required?

@alexmao86 I would also like to remove images from `driver-raspberrypi/src/etc/resources`, I think these are not required.

@sarxos for some classes in etc/resources. it is unused classes for experiment, it is OK to delete them. and I will remove some unused resource.

thanks,
Alex

ok. they are already removed

@alexmao86 Will you send next pull request? Or should I rather remove them by myself?

@sarxos, to simple, please remove it by yourself and then I will sync with you. because I am not skilled git user. :)

@sarxos , let me remove them and send next pull request. I need to change unit test code according to resources deletion. I am free today.
