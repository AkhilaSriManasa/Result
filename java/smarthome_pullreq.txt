 Bose Soundtouch - fixed an issue with async. websocket requests
 When a refresh command is sent to some of the Bose's items, the following exception could be thrown:

```
Exception occurred while informing handler: Blocking message pending 10000 for BLOCKING
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Blocking message pending 10000 for BLOCKING

```
Basically, the issue happens because multiple threads are trying to send commands to the same remote websocket endpoint. So, in order to prevent this, we excahge the usage of `void sendString(String text) throws IOException)` method to `Future<Void> sendStringByFuture(String text)` which initiates an asynchronous transmission of a text message. However, since all places where `sendStringByFuture(String text)` is called are void methods, we do not need to care of getting the future and checking the progress of the transmission.

 Keep persisted disabled status when thing is removed
 The disabled status was not persisted after a restart since it was
removed on shutdown during the thing removal.
Now it will be persisted, but the disabled status of permanently deleted
disabled things will remain as orphan entry in the database.

 Fixed possible stop of FW update execution if exception is present 
 @kaikreuzer This pull request is a continuation of PR #6859.

Basically, #6859 fixed a possible NPE, but didn't provide a fix for the issue that if an exception occurs the firmware transfer may never continue. Here's the reason why:

 Extend usb serial discovery service to contain product ID …
 For better differentiation between different USB devices `UsbSerialDiscoveryService` is extended to add `usb_vendor_id` and `usb_product_id` properties to every thing which represents USB device.

 [OneWire] consolidate thing types and internal refactoring
 - cleanup handlers
- automatic channel addition/removal based on sensor-type
- reduce number of thing types ("digitalio", "digitalio2", "digitalio8", "counter2", "ibutton", "temperature" are now "basic")
- better thing labels after discovery
- better test coverage

This is the second to last PR for refactoring of the OneWire binding (#6842 being the last). With this PR configuration will become a lot easier for the users (only five thing-types (`basic`, `ams`, `bms`, `ms-tx` and `edsenv` and one bridge remain). All other configuration will be done on-the-fly depending on the sensor type.
 Fixed possible NPE in FirmwareUpdateService
 Basically, the method `private synchronized void processFirmwareStatusInfo(FirmwareUpdateHandler firmwareUpdateHandler, FirmwareStatusInfo newFirmwareStatusInfo, @Nullable Firmware latestFirmware)` performs the following operation:

```java
FirmwareStatusInfo previousFirmwareStatusInfo = firmwareStatusInfoMap.put(newFirmwareStatusInfo.getThingUID(), newFirmwareStatusInfo);
```

However, since `put(...)` returns the previous value associated with key, during the first time we set the value for the exact thing UID `previousFirmwareStatusInfo` is effectively assigned `null`. 

Further ahead,`processFirmwareStatusInfo(...)` calls `private void transferLatestFirmware(final FirmwareUpdateBackgroundTransferHandler fubtHandler, final Firmware latestFirmware, final FirmwareStatusInfo previousFirmwareStatusInfo)`, inside which the following operation is performed:

```java
firmwareStatusInfoMap.put(fubtHandler.getThing().getUID(), previousFirmwareStatusInfo);
```

This, in case `previousFirmwareStatusInfo` is `null` directly throws a NPE, since `null` values cannot go in a `ConcurrentHashMap`:

```java
java.lang.NullPointerException
     at java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.putVal(Unknown Source)
     at java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.put(Unknown Source)
     at org.eclipse.smarthome.core.thing.internal.firmware.FirmwareUpdateServiceImpl$2.run(FirmwareUpdateServiceImpl.java:345)
     at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Unknown Source)
     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(Unknown Source)
     at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$201(Unknown Source)
     at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(Unknown Source)
     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(Unknown Source)
     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source)
     at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
``` 

In order to prevent this, a simple non-null check is added.

 [OneWire] simplify multisensor configuration and improve thing discovery
 This PR improves the adnvanced (BMS/AMS) multisensor discovery as requested e.g. [here](https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/issues/6751#issuecomment-450505734).  From now on you only have to set the sensor id of the main sensor, additional sensors are auto-discovered. Also includes code improvements for the discovery service which will make future additions a lot simpler.
