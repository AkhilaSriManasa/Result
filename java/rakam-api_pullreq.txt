 Requestcontext
 
 Implement Presto 0.190
 
 Fix dependency error
 
 Remove continuous query
 
 Fixes for the populate_values changes
 Tablesampling for postgresql added. Checks for presto is done, as it is done for postgresql.
 docker-compose Postgresql healthcheck
 when running `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d` using the code in the README, the `rakam-api` container exits with an error because it can't find the `rakam-db` container yet as it is not fully functional yet.

With the given changes to the .yml, the `rakam-api` container waits with connecting until the `rakam-db` container returns a positive for the command "pg_isready". I found this fix/workaround [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/docker-compose-healthcheck#waiting-for-postgresql-to-be-healthy).

I encountered this issue (and fixed it) while working with the Docker for Mac client (Version 17.09.0-ce-mac35 (19611)).
 Populate values in filter builder backend
 PrestoRakamRaptor is implemented, it queries mysql first to determine the ratio. Then queries presto. Shouldn't be merged yet. To be reviewed.
 Presto Approximate
 I have changed the return value to bigint, started step from 1 (instead of 0) and added a test to check whether it works when dimension is not set.
 Funneltime
 To be reviewed, should not be merged.
 Postgres partitioning
 
 Merge
 
 Push timezone to database
 
 syntax error in funnel_step_time query
 
 Syntax error with funnel_step_time query
 
 COREBI-9 Added sql support to custom mapper
 
 Added MSSQL custom database support
 
 Update README.md
 Small typo changes
 full sentence linking to api documentation
 
 sercan's language change
 
 update postgres version to 9.6.1
 
 corrected the readme. Ref #35
 My 2 cents :)
