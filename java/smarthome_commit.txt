 Extend ChannelType by command options (#5131)

* WIP: Extend ChannelType description by command options

This is WIP and open for discussion.

This addresses #5099 by adding command options as an alternative to a state description.
The implementation is naive and straigt forward.
Command options will be rendered as push buttons by UIs and send the corresponding command value as a command to the channel.
With this proposal, the state of the channel will not be represented in the UI, so ThingHandelers may not even update the state.

 Keep persisted disabled status when thing is removed (#6870)

* Keep persisted disabled status when thing is removed

The disabled status was not persisted after a restart since it was
removed on shutdown during the thing removal.
Now it will be persisted, but the disabled status of permanently deleted
disabled things will remain as orphan entry in the database.

 [mqtt] Rollershutter STOP command, outgoing transform, chained incoming transformations (#6695)

* MQTT: Rollershutter STOP command, outgoing transform

The Rollershutter channel stores its value as percentage.
UP/DOWN/STOP commands received via MQTT do not change that state.

Instead of trying to handle those commands, they are now
posted to the framework.

* Allow outgoing transformations.
* Allow chained incoming transformations.
* Add more examples to the readme.

* PercentageChannel: Return value between min and max. Homie: Remove  handling completely. Readme: Add retain and isCommand and some more mqtt1 details. Rollershutter: Fix

 [OneWire] add better runtime checks (#6852)

* remove unneeded check for thing status
the thing status after the base thing handler completed configure was
checked twice

* remove support for multiple sensor ids

multiple sensor ids were needed for advanced thing-types. #6835 removed
that necessity

* add runtime checks for correct thing-setup

- thing handlers support sensor type
- things have all needed properties

* improve tests

- thing handler tests know check the correct sensor update
- some more completeness tests

 Make min and max value for slider configurable (#6777)

* Make min and max value for slider configurable

Like for the setpoint, the min and max value for a slider can differ based
on the underlying thing that is being controlled, so it shouldn't be
hardcoded and a user should be able to change these values.

The default values, if the parameters are not given, are 0 (minValue) and
100 (maxValue), like they're currently, so that users shouldn't see a
difference when they're not changing their configurations.

Fixes #6776
