 Executor helper methods
 Added method in Executor to get whole graphql response. Today it's only possible to get the data part of the graphql response if you use the Executor as a graphql client. Now it will be possible to get the whole response (data and error),
 Fix typo on manifold-ext/README.md
 Just a simple typo.
 Fix a small typo (Minsu -> Minus)
 
 manifold-jdbc
 This PR suggests PoC manifold-jdbc module with extensions of interfaces ResultSet and CallableStatement.
Originally I used these methods as static imports in my enterprise applications, when I suddenly realized, that it's a pity that java does not support extension methods. Later I used these methods as extensions in my kotlin code.

Some implementation notes:
* intellij annotations usage policy is not clear - I see both no `Nullable` annotations in `ManifoldCollectionExt` and `Nullable` annotations in `graphql` module
 fixed some errors in docs

 I believe this should have been http://

 Fix typo for the example gradle version
 Although once a proper release version comes out, this would've been edited (and fixed) anyway, might as well fix it until the time comes.

 Thank you for a great framework!

 Fix image urls to docs/images
 Fix image urls so they resolve to the images in docs/ directory.

Fix anchor refs which do not resolve to README headings to manifold.system/docs.html

Fix anchor ref for Modes to lowercase, as generated by GitHub for Modes heading.

Remove height="80%", width on its own scales the image proportionally. The height in `%` attribute on JavaFX WebView is interpreted as percent of total page height, not image height, causing the image to stretch vertically.
 Only activate `internal.tools-jar` profile for Java 8
  - Unfortnately, a bug in Maven 3.2.1 and earlier does not allow a profile to have multiple activations
 - Adding maven-enforcer-plugin to build to guarantee that the version of maven used is >= 3.2.2
 - Build will fail with this message if using 3.2.1:
```
[WARNING] Rule 0: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.RequireMavenVersion failed with message:
Detected Maven Version: 3.2.1 is not in the allowed range [3.2.2,).

 Fix for unwanted tools.jar dependency in manifold-all pom.xml
 As discovered on this [SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48715546/maven-how-to-specify-javac-plugin-argument-with-maven-compiler-plugin), our `<system>` scope dependency on `tools.jar` needed to compile the core Manifold libs was leaking in to `manifold-all`'s `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` file, part of the `maven-shade-plugin` execution. This is a little embarrassing since the `java.home` sysprop of the build machine was being exposed and exported in our release builds. 

This one-line fix prevents the `internal.tools-jar` profile from being applied to the `manifold-all` module. In addition, I'm including docs to explain how to use future releases of `manifold-all` with the `maven-surefire-plugin`. Finally, I will update the archetype to reflect these recommended surefire settings.
 fix broken gif in README
 Hello,

I noticed the extension method gif in the README doesn't display properly in Firefox on Linux. This manifests on the [GitHub page.](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold) (see screenshot) The fix is rather trivial, [hopefully you can see that it displays on my branch.](https://github.com/lourkeur/manifold/blob/gif/README.md#the-extension-manifold)

By the way, the project looks amazing for what I can see. I'll look deeper into it than the web console on the GitHub page soon :wink:

 Create Über-jar by adding manifold-all module
  - Aggregates ServiceLoader implementations of m.a.t.ITypeManifold

I uploaded a preview of the über-jar at: https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/systems/manifold/manifold-all/0.1-alpha-1-SNAPSHOT/manifold-all-0.1-alpha-1-20171011.155318-1.jar

Note that collections is missing from the services definition. Is that intentional?
