 fix-issue-2109
 in this PR a dedicated configuration class is used to activate JSF 2.3 features in JBoss EAP 7.3
Injection points like FacesContext and ExternalContext work out of the box in JBoss EAP 7.3 with this class.

No manual CDI Produces are necessary and JSF 2.3 works like described in the JSF docs.
 task-jsf example: JSF 2.3 features does not work on JBoss EAP 7.3
 In the example task-jsf is a CDI Producer used to generate the FacesContext Injection Point from the static method reference.
`    @Produces
    public FacesContext getFacesContext() {
        return FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
    }`

The JSF docs say, the injection from FacesContext and ExternalContext should work out of the box. This does not work in the JBoss EAP 7.3

In my opinion it would be better and easier to understand if a concreate configuration class is used.

In the bug reported for JSF([see here](https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/issues/4308)) such a class is suggested.

`@FacesConfig(version = Version.JSF_2_3)
@ApplicationScoped
public class Config {}`

With this class the example works as designed and all JSF 2.3 features as well.

 JBEAP-17131: Remove xsi-schemalocation
 Removed xsi-schemalocation. This issue is resolved in [JBIDE-18319](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBIDE-18319). 
@parsharma all Quickstarts development happens at https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart repo, you should first clone the JBEAP JIRA to WFLY JIRA, and then submit PR to wildfly repo, and in PR description you should include a line "Issue: WFLY_JIRA_URL", please check PRs over there to see how these are done and worked out

@emmartins do you mean first i have to create issue in JIRA for WFLY? and then commit the changes?


Yes, this is accomplished by first “clone” the JBEAP jira and then “move”
that clone to the WFLY jira project. Then your PR at wildfly/QuickStart
should reference the WFLY issue as shown in other PRs.

 Consider making quickstarts all standalone please
 Hello, 

I'm a Red Hat consultant. One issue that (me/clients) have with using the quickstarts is that they all reference a parent pom.
The use case is that we'd like to take a sample, strip out the stuff we don't need and add our own. The tricky part is making the examples standalone so that they don't rely on parent pom. I've seen this done in the 7.1.x-develop branch.

In general, it would be nice if all examples were all standalone instead of using a parent. Or if not, then explain how to make them standalone.


WildFly is source of origin for all of these quickstarts. You might want to create this issue there: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart


 Updated the html page
 
 Update README.adoc
 The project does not contain a jboss-web.xml
@alteepping : Thanks for submitting this fix! Unfortunately all fixes must be made to the Wildfly repository located here: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.

@emmartins will make sure the changes are propagated to this one.

 Updated link to all quickstarts
 
 messaging-clustering-singleton does not run under Openshift
 messaging-clustering-singleton needs some update before it can run under OpenShift.
The postconfigure.sh will be executed automatically after the container will be started.

BTW: I was not able to create a pull request.
This repository is deprecated, you must create a WFLY jira and work with wildfly/quickstart sources for PR

@rbaumgar : 

This is the URL for the WildFly quickstarts: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart

This is the URL for the WildFly server: https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly

You should be able to test the quickstarts using the master branch.

 Move EAR file in OpenShift deployment directory manually.
 Hi guys!

I run the ejb-in-ear sample but when I checked the console log, the ear file was not moved in OpenShift deployment directory, thats why the application server unable to load the project.

Any workaround ?

Thanks,

 update to 7.2.0.CD13 release
 
 EAP7-696 update guava version to pass with latest Arquilian version
 
This follows up on https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-boms/pull/97

@tremes : This repository is no longer used for development. If you notice, @ctomc posted the JBoss EAP 7.1 final quickstarts here. We won't be updating the 7.1 quickstarts.

I believe you need to make fixes for the 7.2 quickstarts to the https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart repository. Those fixes are then cherry-picked or merged to the https://github.com/jbossas/eap-quickstarts JBoss EAP product repository.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hmm ok...thanks for information

 Learning purpose
 I am downloading this project for EJB jboss learning purpose
This repository is no longer for JBoss development. Please submit pull requests to the https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart repository.

 Openshift
 ya
This PR is not valid and the 7.1 branch of the quickstarts is final.

 7.2.0.CD12-dev3
 Move to the 7.2.0.CD12 bom.
Introduce productization version and repo changes.
Add the generated README.html files.
 Generate and add README.html files to the openshift branch. Fix OpenShift template name.
 @bstansberry : This PR replaces https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/pull/2083.

In addition to the generated README.html files, this PR also updates the OpenShift template name to incorporate the unmerged one defined in https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/pull/2082: JBoss EAP CD (no https).
 Generate and add README.html files to the openshift branch
 
ejb-in-war/ejb-in-war-keystore.jks is not in the zip and isn't in the 7.1 branch variant of the QS. I suspect it got in this PR by mistake.

helloworld-ws and tasks are not in this branch so we shouldn't add their README.html

I've compared all the other README.html files here to the equivalents in the qs zip and they match except for the "Last updated..." text. I think that mismatch is ok.

I've corrected the various things I mentioned ^^^ in commits in the branch where I'm reconciling the deltas to the zip: https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/compare/openshift...bstansberry:toward-zip

@bstansberry : I cleaned up this PR to remove the keystore and the 2 html files. It still contains the old OpenShift template name. I also created a replacement PR that uses the updated OpenShift template name. See https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/pull/2084.
