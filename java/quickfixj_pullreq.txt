 QFJ-22 update documentation for Acceptor configurations
  including failover, SocketAcceptPort and SocketAcceptAddress
 QFJ-684 - added charset support to BytesField
 **Changes**
- `quickfix.BytesField` uses `org.quickfixj.CharsetSupport`

This is the last remaining item from QFJ-789, so possibly this could be closed as well.
 QFJ-375 - configurable timeout multiplier
 Fixes QFJ-375

**Changes**

- session timeout multiplier is configurable (default values retained)
- documentation update

"https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/w_20,h_20/v1561977819/icon/h.png" widthgithub&utm_medium Support setting RefreshOnLogon for Initiators
 Fixes #262 


 Add custom tags to Logon message.
 Adds possibility to specify tags via setting `LogonTag` or `LogonTag<n>`.
Example:
```
LogonTag=553=user
LogonTag1=554=password 
```

It is checked whether a data dictionary is present to determine whether the specified tag is a header field. Otherwise it is put into the body of the message.
 Checkstyle configuration (WIP)
 
 Optimise session reset to reduce Calendar creation
 Attempts to improve Calendar-based memory churn seen in #282 by accessing original calendars and keeping a local cache of temporary ones.
 Add method to DataDictionary to get the value for a given enum value name
  - this is useful for mapping from/to the XML representation obtained
from `Message.toXML()`
 - since the DataDictionary is kind of a memory hog we do not store the
values in yet another HashMap (which would cause Node objects to be created) but iterate over the entries on each call to `getValue(int, String)`
  -- it is up to the user's application to cache the returned values if desired
 Remove unit test obsoleted by change in the order of 'persist' and 'send'
 The unit test was obsoleted due to this PR: https://github.com/quickfix-j/quickfixj/pull/242

The condition described in the test is no longer possible:
>The purpose of this test is to simulate the situation where a logon response is received before a logon request can be successfully persisted to the MessageStore.

 Add optional TLS SNI initiator support

 Restyle QFJ-905 - adding support for MULTIPLECHARVALUE
 
A duplicate of #264 with additional commits that automatically address
incorrect style, created by [Restyled][].

Since the original Pull Request was opened as a fork in a contributor's
repository, we are unable to create a Pull Request branching from it with only
the style fixes.

The following Restylers [made fixes](https://restyled.io/gh/quickfix-j/repos/quickfixj/jobs/224100):

- clang-format


To incorporate these changes, you can either:

1. Merge this Pull Request *instead of* the original, or

1. Ask your contributor to locally incorporate these commits and push them to
   the original Pull Request

   <details>
       <summary>Expand for example instructions</summary>

       ```console
       git remote add upstream https://github.com/quickfix-j/quickfixj.git
       git fetch upstream pull/<this PR number>/head
       git merge --ff-only FETCH_HEAD
       git push
       ```

   </details>


**NOTE**: As work continues on the original Pull Request, this process will
re-run and update (force-push) this Pull Request with updated style fixes as
necessary. If the style is fixed manually at any point (i.e. this process finds
no fixes to make), this Pull Request will be closed automatically.

Sorry if this was unexpected. To disable it, see our [documentation][].

 Add ShortSaleRestriction
 Add ShortSaleRestriction please see : https://github.com/quickfix-j/quickfixj/issues/267, also ended up correcting whitespace.

Fixes #267 
 QFJ-951 - test case covering JIRA description
 I'm going through open JIRAs to see what still needs fixing.

Just added a unit test case suggested in the JIRA. The issue was fixed by https://github.com/quickfix-j/quickfixj/pull/148.

I think the JIRA ticket should be marked as fixed in QFJ 2.1.0
 LGTM alert fix
 Fixed last LGTM alert - unnecessary null check.
 QFJ-905 - adding support for MULTIPLECHARVALUE
 **Changes**

- added support for MULTIPLECHARVALUE

 QFJ-636 - custom fields in component blocks are not added to parent
 **Changes**

- Custom FIX tags are copied to "parent" components.

Unfortunately it is not possible to do a reverse operation as the custom fields copied to "parent" would pollute every child component when retrieving it via "get*" methods. This is something that we don't want, especially when is an existing test case `quickfix.MessageTest#testComponent`.

Arguably we could change the class generation and add extra "get*" methods with additional arguments indicating that all (or selected ones) fields from "parent" components should be copied, but I think it might be a little overhead. The first attempt was done in https://github.com/quickfix-j/quickfixj/pull/210, but I think this is unnecessary clutter.

I updated the javadoc for `quickfix.MessageComponent#copyFrom` and `quickfix.MessageComponent#copyTo` to point out the difference in behaviour.
 Only check for ApplVerID on Logon and application messages
 Fixes #260 
 Fix variable interpolation with custom properties for SessionID
 There is no way to resolve variableValues from custom place (without using system properties) for SessionId fields. But they are used for FIX session creation.
 fix LGTM errors and one typo
 
 Fix LGTM errors
 
 Introduce separate thread pool for establishing Initiator connections
 Fixes #254

 * introduced separate thread pool with 3 threads for connection establishment
 * changed `enabled` flag in `Session` to `volatile` and removed synchronization from `setEnabled`/`isEnabled` since I could not find any good reason why it was synchronized
 Notes on reporting security issues.
 Following up on #252 
 Fix Sending Messages Example Code in User Manual
 There seems to have been a side effect from the QuickFix C++ Manual. I've updated the example code which was not changed to Java.
 QFJ-981 / QFJ-982 Remove settings from DataDictionary class
 Not much testing on this but here's where we're/I'm thinking of going with it.
 Persistence is done before sending and will fail if message cannot be stored or sequence number cannot be incremented.
 This applies a fix from quickfix's main repository https://github.com/quickfix/quickfix/commit/5fb3d4ffc44775295d5525fb30335d57e869f27e.
