 Add custom tags to Logon message. (#285)

Adds possibility to specify tags via setting `LogonTag` or `LogonTag<n>`.

Example:
```
LogonTag=553=user
LogonTag1=554=password 
```

 Add method to DataDictionary to get a value for a given enum value name (#280)

- this is useful for mapping from/to the XML representation obtained
from Message.toXML()
 - since the DataDictionary is kind of a memory hog we do not store the
values in yet another HashMap but iterate over the entries on each call
to getValue(int, String)
  - it is up to the user's application to cache the return values if desired
